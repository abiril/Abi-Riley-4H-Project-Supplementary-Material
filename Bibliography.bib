@article{Gomez-Rubio2020,
abstract = {The integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) is a method for approximate Bayesian inference. In the last years it has established itself as an alternative to other methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo because of its speed and ease of use via the R-INLA package. Although the INLA methodology focuses on models that can be expressed as latent Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRF), this encompasses a large family of models that are used in practice. This book is aimed at providing an introduction to the INLA method and the associated INLA (or R-INLA) package. It starts with a short introduction to Bayesian inference in order to place INLA within context. Next, an introduction to the INLA method is given, and followed by two simple examples on using the INLA package for the R statistical software. Next, different types of widely used models are described in different chapters. To mention a few, these include mixed-effects models, multilevel models, spatial and spatio-temporal models, smoothing methods, survival analysis and others. In addition to describing how to use the INLA package for model fitting, some advanced features available are covered as well. These are commonly employed to build different types of models, as well as to implement new latent effects and priors within the INLA framework. This is particularly important as it makes model fitting more flexible. Among the advanced features discussed, it is worth mentioning models with several likelihoods (to build joint models), shared effects between different likelihoods and the possibility to embed INLA within MCMC algorithms for flexible model fitting. One idea that has been stressed in the book is that INLA can be used as a toolbox and that it can be combined with other methods for Bayesian inference. This is particular interesting when building models that do not fall within the class of latent GMRF. Two examples include mixture models and imputation mechanisms of missing observations in the latent GMRF. Another important issue about this book is that a Gitbook version is available from the book website, and I can only thank my editor John Kimmel and the publisher for agreeing with this. This has also been possible thanks to the use of rmarkdown (Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018) and the bookdown (Xie 2016) packages. Furthermore, all examples in the book are fully reproducible, with datasets and R code available from the book website.},

abstract = {In many fields and applications, count data can be subject to delayed reporting. This is where the total count, such as the number of disease cases contracted in a given week, may not be immediately available, instead arriving in parts over time. For short-term decision making, the statistical challenge lies in predicting the total count based on any observed partial counts, along with a robust quantification of uncertainty. We discuss previous approaches to modeling delayed reporting and present a multivariate hierarchical framework where the count generating process and delay mechanism are modeled simultaneously in a flexible way. This framework can also be easily adapted to allow for the presence of underreporting in the final observed count. To illustrate our approach and to compare it with existing frameworks, we present a case study of reported dengue fever cases in Rio de Janeiro. Based on both within-sample and out-of-sample posterior predictive model checking and arguments of interpretability, adaptability, and computational efficiency, we discuss the relative merits of different approaches.},

This multi-patch influenza model consists of a SEIAR influenza transmission model and flow model between two districts. This model is based on the daily confirmed cases of A/H1N1 influenza collected by the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention from April 27 to September 15, 2009 and the daily commuting data from 33 districts of SMA reported in the 2010 Population and Housing Census (PHC). We analyzed the spread patterns of 2009 influenza in the SMA by the reproductive numbers and geographic information systems. During the early period of novel influenza pandemics, when pharmaceutical interventions are lacking, non-pharmaceutical public health interventions will be the most critical strategies for impeding the spread of influenza and delaying an epidemic. Using the spatial-temporal model developed herein, we also investigated the impact of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions, isolation and/or commuting restrictions, on the incidence reduction in various scenarios. Our model provides scientific evidence for predicting the spread of disease and preparedness for a future pandemic.},

R0 is affected by numerous biological, sociobehavioral, and environmental factors that govern pathogen transmission and, therefore, is usually estimated with various types of complex mathematical models, which make R0 easily misrepresented, misinterpreted, and misapplied. R0 is not a biological constant for a pathogen, a rate over time, or a measure of disease severity, and R0 cannot be modified through vaccination campaigns. R0 is rarely measured directly, and modeled R0 values are dependent on model structures and assumptions. Some R0 values reported in the scientific literature are likely obsolete. R0 must be estimated, reported, and applied with great caution because this basic metric is far from simple.},

This book brings together the specialised and widely-dispersed literature on spatial analysis to make these methodological tools accessible to epidemiologists for the first time. With its focus on application rather than theory, this book includes examples taken from both medical (human) and veterinary (animal) disciplines, and describes both infectious diseases and non-infectious conditions.

abstract = {Disease mapping aims to determine the underlying disease risk from scattered epidemiological data and to represent it on a smoothed colored map. This methodology is based on Bayesian inference and is classically dedicated to non-infectious diseases whose incidence is low and whose cases distribution is spatially (and eventually temporally) structured. Over the last decades, disease mapping has received many major improvements to extend its scope of application: integrating the temporal dimension, dealing with missing data, taking into account various a prioris (environmental and population covariates, assumptions concerning the repartition and the evolution of the risk), dealing with overdispersion, etc. We aim to adapt this approach to rare infectious diseases. In the context of a contagious disease, the outcome of a primary case can in addition generate secondary occurrences of the pathology in a close spatial and temporal neighborhood; this can result in local overdispersion and in higher spatial and temporal dependencies due to direct and/or indirect transmission. We have proposed and tested 60 Bayesian hierarchical models on 400 simulated datasets and bovine tuberculosis real data. This analysis shows the relevance of the CAR (Conditional AutoRegressive) processes to deal with the structure of the risk. We can also conclude that the negative binomial models outperform the Poisson models with a Gaussian noise to handle overdispersion. In addition our study provided relevant maps which are congruent with the real risk (simulated data) and with the knowledge concerning bovine tuberculosis (real data).},

In particular, we prove that there are situations where "slowing down" the individuals can trigger an epidemic that would not propagate otherwise.

This model does not take into consideration the spatial distribution of each subgroup, but considers the total number of individuals belonging to each subgroup. There are many variants of the SIR-model. For studying the spatial distribution, stochastic processes have often been introduced to describe the dispersion of individuals. Such assumptions do not seem to be applicable to humans, because almost everyone moves within a small fixed radius in practice. Even if individuals do not disperse, the transmission of disease occurs. In this paper, we do not assume the dispersion of individuals, and instead use the infectious radius. Then, we propose simple continuous and discrete SIR-models that show spatial distributions. The results of our simulations show that the propagation speed and size of an epidemic depend on the population density and the infectious radius.},

abstract = {The study of epidemics spreading with community structure has become a hot topic. The classic S I R epidemic model does not distinguish between dead and recovered individuals. It is inappropriate to classify dead individuals as recovered individuals because the real-world epidemic spread processes show different recovery rates and death rates in different communities. In the present work, a S I R D epidemic model with different recovery rates is proposed. We pay more attention to the changes in the number of dead individuals. The basic reproductive number is obtained. The stationary solutions of a disease-free state and an endemic state are given. We show that quarantining communities can decrease the basic reproductive number, and the total number of dead individuals decreases in a disease-free steady state with an increase in the number of quarantined communities. The most effective quarantining strategy is to preferentially quarantine some communities/cities with a greater population size and a fraction of initially infected individuals. Furthermore, we show that the population flows from a low recovery rate and high population density community/city/country to some high recovery rate and low population density communities/cities/countries, which helps to reduce the total number of dead individuals and prevent the prevalence of epidemics. The numerical simulations on the real-world network and the synthetic network further support our conclusions.},

We suppose homogeneous Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) populations, and we consider in our simulations, a grid of colored cells, which represents the whole domain affected by the epidemic while each cell can represent a sub-domain or region. Second, in order to minimize the number of infected individuals in one region, we propose an optimal control approach based on a travel-blocking vicinity strategy which aims to control only one cell by restricting movements of infected people coming from all neighboring cells. Thus, we show the influence of the optimal control approach on the controlled cell. We should also note that the cellular modeling approach we propose here, can also describes infection dynamics of regions which are not necessarily attached one to an other, even if no empty space can be viewed between cells. The theoretical method we follow for the characterization of the travel-locking optimal controls, is based on a discrete version of Pontryagin's maximum principle while the numerical approach applied to the multi-points boundary value problems we obtain here, is based on discrete progressive-regressive iterative schemes. We illustrate our modeling and control approaches by giving an example of 100 regions.},

Unfortunately, most of the existing models are either too fine-grained to be efficient or too coarse-grained to be reliable. Here we propose a computationally efficient hybrid approach that uses SIR model for individual cities which are in turn coupled via empirical transportation networks that facilitate migration among them. The treatment presented here differs from existing models in two crucial ways: first, self-consistent determination of coupling parameters so as to maintain the populations of individual cities, and second, the incorporation of distance dependent temporal delays in migration. We apply our model to Indian aviation as well as railway networks taking into account populations of more than 300 cities. Our results project that through the domestic transportation, the significant population is poised to be exposed within 90 days of the onset of epidemic. Thus, serious supervision of domestic transport networks is warranted even after restricting international migration.},

When we have several measurements recorded at each spatial location (for example, information on p ≥ 2 diseases from the same population groups or regions), we need to consider multivariate areal data models in order to handle the dependence among the multivariate components as well as the spatial dependence between sites. In this article, we propose a flexible new class of generalized multivariate conditionally autoregressive (GMCAR) models for areal data, and show how it enriches the MCAR class. Our approach differs from earlier ones in that it directly specifies the joint distribution for a multivariate Markov random field (MRF) through the specification of simpler conditional and marginal models. This in turn leads to a significant reduction in the computational burden in hierarchical spatial random effect modeling, where posterior summaries are computed using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We compare our approach with existing MCAR models in the literature via simulation, using average mean square error (AMSE) and a convenient hierarchical model selection criterion, the deviance information criterion (DIC; Spiegelhalter et al., 2002, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B64, 583-639). Finally, we offer a real-data application of our proposed GMCAR approach that models lung and esophagus cancer death rates during 1991-1998 in Minnesota counties.},

Historical Background Scientists across a wide range of disciplines have long recognized the importance of spatial dependencies in their data and the underlying process of interest. Initially due to computational limitations, they dealt with such dependencies by randomization and blocking rather than the explicit characterization of the dependencies in their models. Early developments in spatial modeling started in the 1950's and 1960's motivated by problems in mining engineering and meteorology [11], followed by the introduction of Markov random fields [2]. The application of hierarchical spatial and spatio-temporal models have become increasingly popular since the advancements of computational techniques, such as MCMC methods, in the later years of the 20th century. Scientific Fundamentals Methods for spatial and spatio-temporal modeling are becoming increasingly important in the environmental sciences and other sciences where data arise from processes in spatial settings. Unfortunately, the application of traditional covariance-based spatial statistical models is either inappropriate or computationally inefficient in many problems. Moreover, conventional methods are often incapable of allowing the researcher to quantify uncertainties corresponding to the model parameters since the parameter space of most complex spatial and spatio-temporal models is very large.

abstract = {Spatial data with covariate measurement errors have been commonly observed in public health studies. Existing work mainly concentrates on parameter estimation using Gibbs sampling, and no work has been conducted to understand and quantify the theoretical impact of ignoring measurement error on spatial data analysis in the form of the asymptotic biases in regression coefficients and variance components when measurement error is ignored. Plausible implementations, from frequentist perspectives, of maximum likelihood estimation in spatial covariate measurement error models are also elusive. In this paper, we propose a new class of linear mixed models for spatial data in the presence of covariate measurement errors. We show that the naive estimators of the regression coefficients are attenuated while the naive estimators of the variance components are inflated, if measurement error is ignored. We further develop a structural modeling approach to obtaining the maximum likelihood estimator by accounting for the measurement error. We study the large sample properties of the proposed maximum likelihood estimator, and propose an EM algorithm to draw inference. AU the asymptotic properties are shown under the increasing-domain asymptotic framework. We illustrate the method by analyzing the Scottish lip cancer data, and evaluate its performance through a simulation study, all of which elucidate the importance of adjusting for covariate measurement errors.},

There is increasingly vast amounts of data for such processes from geographical information systems, remote sensing platforms, monitoring networks, and computer models. In addition, often there is a great variety of scientific knowledge available for such systems, from partial differential equations based on first principles to panel surveys. It is argued that it is not generally adequate to consider such processes from a joint perspective. Instead, the processes often must be considered as a coherently linked system of conditional models. This paper provides a brief overview of hierarchical approaches applied to environmental processes. The key elements of such models can be considered in three general stages, the data stage, process stage, and parameter stage. In each stage, complicated dependence structure is mitigated by conditioning. For example, the data stage can incorporate measurement errors as well as multiple datasets with varying supports. The process and parameter stages can allow spatial and spatio-temporal processes as well as the direct inclusion of scientific knowledge. The paper concludes with a discussion of some outstanding problems in hierarchical modelling of environmental systems, including the need for new collaboration approaches.},

Starting from the general model formulation regarding the specification of transmission and recovery rates, as well as the population migration dynamics, several subsequent assumptions are introduced that simplify analytical tractability and practical implementation. In particular, linearization involving a deterministic functional representation for the average evolution of the fraction of susceptible individuals allows the formulation of an extended Kalman filter approach for estimation based on the time series observed at a finite set of locations.

In this article we extend existing hierarchical spatial models to account for temporal effects and spatio-temporal interactions. Fitting the resulting highly parameterized models requires careful implementation of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, as well as novel techniques for model evaluation and selection.

abstract = {In this paper, we provide critical reviews of methods suggested for the analysis of aggregate count data in the context of disease mapping and spatial regression. We introduce a new method for picking prior distributions, and propose a number of refinements of previously used models. We also consider ecological bias, mutual standardization, and choice of both spatial model and prior specification. We analyze male lip cancer incidence data collected in Scotland over the period 1975-1980, and outline a number of problems with previous analyses of these data. In disease mapping studies, hierarchical models can provide robust estimation of area-level risk parameters, though care is required in the choice of covariate model, and it is important to assess the sensitivity of estimates to the spatial model chosen, and to the prior specifications on the variance parameters. Spatial ecological regression is a far more hazardous enterprise for two reasons. First, there is always the possibility of ecological bias, and this can only be alleviated by the inclusion of individual-level data. For the Scottish data, we show that the previously used mean model has limited interpretation from an individual perspective. Second, when residual spatial dependence is modeled, and if the exposure has spatial structure, then estimates of exposure association parameters will change when compared with those obtained from the independence across space model, and the data alone cannot choose the form and extent of spatial correlation that is appropriate.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To predict the spatial distributions of Schistosoma haematobium and S. mansoni infections to assist planning the implementation of mass distribution of praziquantel as part of an on-going national control programme in Tanzania. METHODS: Bayesian geostatistical models were developed using parasitological data from 143 schools. RESULTS: In the S. haematobium models, although land surface temperature and rainfall were significant predictors of prevalence, they became non-significant when spatial correlation was taken into account. In the S. mansoni models, distance to water bodies and annual minimum temperature were significant predictors, even when adjusting for spatial correlation. Spatial correlation occurred over greater distances for S. haematobium than for S. mansoni. Uncertainties in predictions were examined to identify areas requiring further data collection before programme implementation. CONCLUSION: Bayesian geostatistical analysis is a powerful and statistically robust tool for identifying high prevalence areas in a heterogeneous and imperfectly known environment. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Wikle2015,
abstract = {Spatio-temporal statistical models are increasingly being used across a wide variety of scientific disciplines to describe and predict spatially explicit processes that evolve over time. Although descriptive models that approach this problem from the second-order (covariance) perspective are important, many real-world processes are dynamic, and it can be more efficient in such cases to characterize the associated spatio-temporal dependence by the use of dynamical models. The challenge with the specification of such dynamical models has been related to the curse of dimensionality and the specification of realistic dependence structures. Even in fairly simple linear/Gaussian settings, spatio-temporal statistical models are often over parameterized. This problem is compounded when the spatio-temporal dynamical processes are nonlinear or multivariate. Hierarchical models have proven invaluable in their ability to deal to some extent with this issue by allowing dependency among groups of parameters and science-based parameterizations. Such models are best considered from a Bayesian perspective, with associated computational challenges. Spatio-temporal statistics remains an active and vibrant area of research.},

abstract = {In Italy, 128,948 confirmed cases and 15,887 deaths of people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were registered as of 5 April 2020. Ending the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires implementation of multiple population-wide strategies, including social distancing, testing and contact tracing. We propose a new model that predicts the course of the epidemic to help plan an effective control strategy. The model considers eight stages of infection: susceptible (S), infected (I), diagnosed (D), ailing (A), recognized (R), threatened (T), healed (H) and extinct (E), collectively termed SIDARTHE. Our SIDARTHE model discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed individuals is important because the former are typically isolated and hence less likely to spread the infection. This delineation also helps to explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the epidemic spread. We compare simulation results with real data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, and we model possible scenarios of implementation of countermeasures. Our results demonstrate that restrictive social-distancing measures will need to be combined with widespread testing and contact tracing to end the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.},

We investigate the impact that different mixing assumptions have on the spread an infectious disease in an age-structured ordinary differential equation model. We consider the impact of heterogeneity in susceptibility and infectivity within the population on the disease transmission. We apply the analysis to the spread of a smallpox-like disease, derive the formula for the reproduction number, ℜ0, and based on this threshold parameter, show the level of human behavioral change required to control the epidemic. We analyze how different mixing patterns can affect the disease prevalence, the cumulative number of new infections, and the final epidemic size. Our analysis indicates that the combination of residual immunity and behavioral changes during a smallpox-like disease outbreak can play a key role in halting infectious disease spread; and that realistic mixing patterns must be included in the epidemic model for the predictions to accurately reect reality.},

We demonstrate how geographical regions, rather than a single, national approach, are likely to lead to better outcomes for the population. We provide a full account of how our models function, and how they can be used to explore many different aspects of contagion, including: experimenting with different lockdown measures, with connectivity between places, with the tracing of disease clusters, and the use of improved contact tracing and isolation. We provide comprehensive results showing the use of these models in given scenarios, and conclude that explicitly regionalized models for mitigation provide significant advantages over a “one-size-fits-all” approach. We have made our models, and their data, publicly available for others to use in their own locales, with the hope of providing the tools needed for geographers to have a voice during this difficult time.},

abstract = {The SIR-model is a basic epidemic model that classifies a population into three subgroups: susceptible S, infected I and removed R. This model does not take into consideration the spatial distribution of each subgroup, but considers the total number of individuals belonging to each subgroup. There are many variants of the SIR-model. For studying the spatial distribution, stochastic processes have often been introduced to describe the dispersion of individuals. Such assumptions do not seem to be applicable to humans, because almost everyone moves within a small fixed radius in practice. Even if individuals do not disperse, the transmission of disease occurs. In this paper, we do not assume the dispersion of individuals, and instead use the infectious radius. Then, we propose simple continuous and discrete SIR-models that show spatial distributions. The results of our simulations show that the propagation speed and size of an epidemic depend on the population density and the infectious radius.},

This approach enables us to evaluate the effect of mobility restriction policies on the spread of the disease. We use data on daily human mobility across regions and apply the Bayesian framework to estimate the proposed model. The results show that the spread of the disease in China was predominately driven by community transmission within regions and the lockdown policy introduced by local governments curbed the spread of the pandemic. Further, we document that Hubei was only the epicenter of the early epidemic stage. Secondary epicenters, such as Beijing and Guangdong, had already become established by late January 2020, and the disease spread out to connected regions. The transmission from these epicenters substantially declined following the introduction of human mobility restrictions across regions.},

Analytical results on the asymptotic and transient behaviors of the system are carried out. Based on the available Italian movement data, a national spatial contact matrix at the regional level, which could be used for new studies on the transmission dynamics of other infectious diseases, is derived for modeling fluxes of individuals. Despite the small number of fitted parameters, model simulations are in good agreement with the observed average HAV incidence in all regions. Our results suggest that the mass vaccination program introduced in one Italian region only (Puglia, the one with the highest endemicity level) could have played a role in the decline of HAV incidence in the country as a whole. The only notable exception is represented by Campania, a Southern region showing a high endemicity level, which is not substantially affected by HAV dynamics in Puglia. Finally, our results highlight that the continuation of the vaccination campaign in Puglia would have a relevant impact in decreasing long-term HAV prevalence, especially in Southern Italy. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Infectious diseases affect public health and regularly gain attention during epidemics. Seasonal waves of influenza and norovirus outbreaks demonstrate the ease of epidemic spread of microparasitic pathogens. Epidemic models enable predictions and support the understanding of infectious disease spread. They are increasingly recognized as a useful tool to inform public health policies. Epidemic models originally consisted of mathematical descriptions of the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals in a population over time. However, spatial data on infectious disease occurrence are becoming more readily available from established public health surveillance systems. This enables spatiotemporal epidemic modelling, statistical inference, and thus spatial predictions. Regression approaches for such},

We focus on stochastic modeling that accounts for basic mechanisms of disease distribution and multi-sourced in situ uncertainties. Starting from the general formulation of population migration dynamics and the specification of transmission and recovery rates, the model studies the functional formulation of the evolution of the fractions of susceptible-infected-recovered individuals. The suggested approach is capable of: a) modeling population dynamics within and across localities, b) integrating the disease representation (i.e. susceptible-infected-recovered individuals) with observation time series at different geographical locations and other sources of information (e.g. hard and soft data, empirical relationships, secondary information), and c) generating predictions of disease spread and associated parameters in real time, while considering model and observation uncertainties. Key aspects of the proposed approach are illustrated by means of simulations (i.e. synthetic studies), and a real-world application using hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) data from China. {\textcopyright} 2013 Angulo et al.},

Using the Jacobian matrix, the stability of the equilibrium points of the system without vaccination is analyzed. The basic reproduction number R is got. In order to study the important role of vaccination to prevent diseases, the model with distributed delay under impulsive vaccination is formulated. And the sufficient conditions of globally asymptotic stability of "infection-free" periodic solution and the permanence of the model are obtained by using Floquet's theorem, small-amplitude perturbation skills, and comparison theorem. Lastly, numerical simulation is presented to illustrate our main conclusions that vaccination has significant effects on the dynamical behaviors of the model. The results can provide effective tactic basis for the practical infectious disease prevention. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wencai Zhao et al.},

A spatio-temporal Gaussian process is defined through a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) which is solved using spectral methods. In contrast to the traditional geostatistical way of relying on the covariance function, the spectral SPDE approach is computationally tractable and provides a realistic space-time parametrization. This package aims at providing tools for simulating and modeling of spatio-temporal processes using an SPDE based approach. The package contains functions for obtaining parametrizations, such as propagator or innovation covariance matrices, of the spatio-temporal model. This allows for building customized hierarchical Bayesian models using the SPDE based model at the process stage. The functions of the package then provide computationally efficient algorithms needed for doing inference with the hierarchical model. Furthermore, an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm implemented in the package can be used as an algorithm for doing inference without any additional modeling. This function is flexible and allows for application specific customizing. The MCMC algorithm supports data that follow a Gaussian or a censored distribution with point mass at zero. Spatio-temporal covariates can be included in the model through a regression term.},

abstract = {Analyzing spatial data often requires modeling dependencies created by a dynamic spatio-temporal data generating process. In many applications, a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) is used with a random effect to account for spatial dependence and to provide optimal spatial predictions. Location-specific covariates are often included as fixed effects in a GLMM and may be collinear with the spatial random effect, which can negatively affect inference. We propose a dynamic approach to account for spatial dependence that incorporates scientific knowledge of the spatio-temporal data generating process. Our approach relies on a dynamic spatio-temporal model that explicitly incorporates location-specific covariates. We illustrate our approach with a spatially varying ecological diffusion model implemented using a computationally efficient homogenization technique. We apply our model to understand individual-level and location-specific risk factors associated with chronic wasting disease in white-tailed deer from Wisconsin, USA and estimate the location the disease was first introduced. We compare our approach to several existing methods that are commonly used in spatial statistics. Our spatio-temporal approach resulted in a higher predictive accuracy when compared to methods based on optimal spatial prediction, obviated confounding among the spatially indexed covariates and the spatial random effect, and provided additional information that will be important for containing disease outbreaks.},

Bayes and empirical Bayes methods have proven useful in smoothing crude maps of disease risk, eliminating the instability of estimates in low-population areas while maintaining geographic resolution. In this article we extend existing hierarchical spatial models to account for temporal effects and spatio-temporal interactions.

Depicting the spatiotemporal pattern of disease is important for disease regulator and deterrence strategies. Spatiotemporal modeling has distended broad veneration in recent years. Spatial and spatiotemporal disease modeling is extensively used for the analysis of registry data and usually articulated in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. In this study, we have developed the hierarchical spatiotemporal Bayesian modeling of the infected rate of Visceral leishmaniasis in Human (VLH). We applied the Stochastics Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach for a spatiotemporal hierarchical model for Visceral leishmaniasis in human (VLH) that involves a GF and a state process is associated with an autoregressive order one temporal dynamics and the spatially correlated error term, along with the effect of land shield, metrological, demographic, socio-demographic and geographical covariates in an endemic area of Amhara regional state, Ethiopia. The model encompasses a Gaussian Field (GF), affected by an error term, and a state process described by a first-order autoregressive dynamic model and spatially correlated innovations. A hierarchical model including spatially and temporally correlated errors was fit to the infected rate of Visceral leishmaniasis in human (VLH) weekly data from January 2015 to December 2017 using the R package R-INLA, which allows for Bayesian modeling using the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach. We found that the mean weekly temperature had a significant positive association with infected rate of VLH. Moreover, net migration rate, clean water coverage, average number of households, population density per square kilometer, average number of persons per household unit, education coverage, health facility coverage, mortality rate, and sex ratio had a significant association with the infected rate of visceral leishmaniasis (VLH) in the region. In this study, we investigated the dynamic spatiotemporal modeling of Visceral leishmaniasis in Human (VLH) through a stochastic partial differential equation approach (SPDE) using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA). Our study had confirmed both metrological, demographic, sociodemographic and geographic covariates had a significant association with the infected rate of visceral leishmaniasis (VLH) in the region.},

Numerous research contributions to spatiotemporal modeling approaches exhibit their strengths differently with increasing complexity. However, contributions that combine spatiotemporal approaches to modeling of multiple diseases simultaneously are not so common. We present a full Bayes-ian hierarchical spatio-temporal approach to the joint modeling of Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Tuberculosis incidences in Kenya. Using case notification data for the period 2012-2017, we estimated the model parameters and determined the joint spatial patterns and temporal variations. Our model included specific and shared spatial and temporal effects. The specific random effects allowed for departures from the shared patterns for the different diseases. The space-time interaction term characterized the underlying spatial patterns with every temporal fluctuation. We assumed the shared random effects to be the structured effects and the disease-specific random effects to be unstructured effects. We detected the spatial similarity in the distribution of Tuberculosis and Human Immunodefi-ciency Virus in approximately 29 counties around the western, central and southern regions of Kenya. The distribution of the shared relative risks had minimal difference with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus disease-specific relative risk whereas that of Tuberculosis presented many more counties as high-risk areas. The flexibility and informative outputs of Bayesian Hierarchical Models enabled us to identify the similarities and differences in the distribution of the relative risks associated with each disease. Estimating the Human Immu-nodeficiency Virus and Tuberculosis shared relative risks provide additional insights towards collaborative monitoring of the diseases and control efforts.},

For each city/country, we include the six most important numbers for epidemic research: daily new infections, accumulated infections , daily new recoveries, accumulated recoveries, daily new deaths, and accumulated deaths. We cross validate the dataset and the estimate error rate is about 0.04%. We then give several examples to show how to trace the spreading in particular cities or provinces, and also contrast the development of COVID-19 in all cities in China at the early, middle and late stages. We hope this dataset can help researchers around the world better understand the spreading dynamics of COVID-19 at a regional level, to inform intervention and mitigation strategies for policymakers.},

abstract = {The number of spatiotemporal data sets has increased rapidly in the last years, which demands robust and fast methods to extract information from this kind of data. Here, we propose a network-based model, called Chronnet, for spatiotemporal data analysis. The network construction process consists of dividing a geometric space into grid cells represented by nodes connected chronologically. Strong links in the network represent consecutive recurrent events between cells. The chronnet construction process is fast, making the model suitable to process large data sets. Using artificial and real data sets, we show how chronnets can capture data properties beyond simple statistics, like frequent patterns, spatial changes, outliers, and spatiotemporal clusters. Therefore, we conclude that chronnets represent a robust tool for the analysis of spatiotemporal data sets.},

abstract = {Background: WHO has called for increased testing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but countries have taken different approaches and the effectiveness of alternative strategies is unknown. We aimed to investigate the potential impact of different testing and isolation strategies on transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods: We developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission based on infectiousness and PCR test sensitivity over time since infection. We estimated the reduction in the effective reproduction number (R) achieved by testing and isolating symptomatic individuals, regular screening of high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms, and quarantine of contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases identified through test-and-trace protocols. The expected effectiveness of different testing strategies was defined as the percentage reduction in R. We reviewed data on the performance of antibody tests reported by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics and examined their implications for the use of so-called immunity passports. Findings: If all individuals with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 self-isolated and self-isolation was 100% effective in reducing onwards transmission, self-isolation of symptomatic individuals would result in a reduction in R of 47% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 32–55). PCR testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection soon after symptom onset could reduce the number of individuals needing to self-isolate, but would also reduce the effectiveness of self-isolation (around 10% would be false negatives). Weekly screening of health-care workers and other high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms by use of PCR testing is estimated to reduce their contribution to SARS-CoV-2 transmission by 23% (95% UI 16–40), on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms, assuming results are available at 24 h. The effectiveness of test and trace depends strongly on coverage and the timeliness of contact tracing, potentially reducing R by 26% (95% UI 14–35) on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms, if 80% of cases and contacts are identified and there is immediate testing following symptom onset and quarantine of contacts within 24 h. Among currently available antibody tests, performance has been highly variable, with specificity around 90% or lower for rapid diagnostic tests and 95–99% for laboratory-based ELISA and chemiluminescent assays. Interpretation: Molecular testing can play an important role in prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially among health-care workers and other high-risk groups, but no single strategy will reduce R below 1 at current levels of population immunity. Immunity passports based on antibody tests or tests for infection face substantial technical, legal, and ethical challenges. Funding: UK Medical Research Council.},

abstract = {Background: COVID-19 has the potential to cause substantial disruptions to health services, due to cases overburdening the health system or response measures limiting usual programmatic activities. We aimed to quantify the extent to which disruptions to services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria in low-income and middle-income countries with high burdens of these diseases could lead to additional loss of life over the next 5 years. Methods: Assuming a basic reproduction number of 3{\textperiodcentered}0, we constructed four scenarios for possible responses to the COVID-19 pandemic: no action, mitigation for 6 months, suppression for 2 months, or suppression for 1 year. We used established transmission models of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria to estimate the additional impact on health that could be caused in selected settings, either due to COVID-19 interventions limiting activities, or due to the high demand on the health system due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: In high-burden settings, deaths due to HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria over 5 years could increase by up to 10%, 20%, and 36%, respectively, compared with if there was no COVID-19 pandemic. The greatest impact on HIV was estimated to be from interruption to antiretroviral therapy, which could occur during a period of high health system demand. For tuberculosis, the greatest impact would be from reductions in timely diagnosis and treatment of new cases, which could result from any prolonged period of COVID-19 suppression interventions. The greatest impact on malaria burden could be as a result of interruption of planned net campaigns. These disruptions could lead to a loss of life-years over 5 years that is of the same order of magnitude as the direct impact from COVID-19 in places with a high burden of malaria and large HIV and tuberculosis epidemics. Interpretation: Maintaining the most critical prevention activities and health-care services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria could substantially reduce the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Because of limited available data, assessments of the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on this virus spread remain challenging. Using a mobility-driven transmission model, we show that NPIs reduced the reproduction number from >3 to 1 to 1.6 in S{\~{a}}o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Sequencing of 427 new genomes and analysis of a geographically representative genomic dataset identified >100 international virus introductions in Brazil. We estimate that most (76%) of the Brazilian strains fell in three clades that were introduced from Europe between 22 February and 11 March 2020. During the early epidemic phase, we found that SARS-CoV-2 spread mostly locally and within state borders. After this period, despite sharp decreases in air travel, we estimated multiple exportations from large urban centers that coincided with a 25% increase in average traveled distances in national flights. This study sheds new light on the epidemic transmission and evolutionary trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Brazil and provides evidence that current interventions remain insufficient to keep virus transmission under control in this country.},

abstract = {Infectious diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide; in modern times, diseases such as HIV and malaria remain a significant public health burden leading to death of millions each year. Interestingly, both human evolution and the collapse of nations have been attributed to disease outbreaks. Famous examples include the so-called Antonine plagues in the Roman Empire, the collapse of the Chinese Han Empire, the defeat of the Aztecs by Cortez and the fall of the Inca Empire. 1 The idea that mathematical modeling can be a powerful tool to study infectious disease dates back to the 18th century when Daniel Bernoulli studied how variolation can be used to reduce the burden of smallpox. 2 At the beginning of the 20th century, the seminal model that Ross 3 developed combined with the work of Kermack and McKendrick 4-6 laid the theoretical pillars of mathematical epidemiology. More so, both landmark studies have shown the practical usefulness of using mathematical models to combat infectious diseases. Ross's work revealed that mosquitoes transmit malaria; nonetheless, it was essential to construct a mathematical model in order to establish that it is sufficient to reduce the mosquito population (not eliminate) in order to control malaria. Ross's work corroborated that epidemics are governed by threshold dynamics. A few years later Kermark and Mckendrick 4 developed the well-known, susceptible, infected, recovered framework (SIR), which is the basis of most modern infectious disease models. The simplest version of the SIR formulation can be described using ordinary differential equations. The analysis of the model has led to the fundamental concept of the basic reproduction number, defined as the average number of people infected by an infected individual over the disease infectivity period, in an entirely susceptible population. The basic reproduction number (R 0) serves as a threshold parameter and can be represented using the model parameters. In addition, the mathematical analysis of the SIR model reveals that the size of the outbreak depends on the initial fraction of susceptibles, and on R 0 and will not depend on the initial number of infectives. In our days, infectious disease modeling is considered a fundamental tool for studying, understanding and revealing the fundamental mechanisms that influence the spread of epidemics. 7,8 Moreover, modeling provides an essential tool for testing different possible public health policies to minimize the impact of outbreaks in the form of testing different control strategies (e.g. vaccination) and prediction of future disease trends. 9,10 In fact, models are often the only means of identifying and testing policy alternatives, which cannot be tested experimentally due to various reasons such as limited budget and ethical constraints. 11 The idea that mathematical models of infectious diseases should be confronted with real data, combined with the fact that all models are, at best, simplified representations of the real world raises the need for uncertainty quantification. In particular, statistical methodologies should be used in order to allow testing and validating which assumptions agree better with reality. Indeed, statistical learning (inference, prediction) of dynamic systems involves ''standard'' statistical problems such as studying the identifiability of a model, estimating model parameters, predicting future states of the system, testing hypotheses and choosing the ''best'' model. 12-17 However, modern dynamic systems are typically very complex: nonlinear, high dimensional and only partly measured. Moreover, data may be sparse and noisy. Thus, statistical learning of dynamical systems is not a trivial task in practice which leads to difficulties in understanding the process and in generating valid inference and reliable predictions.},

Diagnostic and prognostic inferences from statistical models are critical to researchers advancing science, clinical practitioners making patient care decisions, and administrators and policy makers impacting the health care system to improve quality and reduce costs. The veracity of such inferences relies not only on the quality and completeness of the collected data, but also statistical model validity. A key component of establishing model validity is determining when a model is not correctly specified and therefore incapable of adequately representing the Data Generating Process (DGP). In this article, model validity is first described and methods designed for assessing model fit, specification, and selection are reviewed. Second, data transformations that improve the model's ability to represent the DGP are addressed. Third, model search and validation methods are discussed. Finally, methods for evaluating predictive and classification performance are presented. Together, these methods provide a practical framework with recommendations to guide the development and evaluation of statistical models that provide valid statistical inferences.},

In many applications it will be preferable to work with multivariate spatial processes to specify such models. A critical specification in providing these models is the cross covariance function. Constructive approaches for developing valid cross-covariance functions offer the most practical strategy for doing this. These approaches include separability, kernel convolution or moving average methods, and convolution of covariance functions. We review these approaches but take as our main focus the computationally manageable class referred to as the linear model of coregionalization (LMC). We introduce a fully Bayesian development of the LMC. We offer clarification of the connection between joint and conditional approaches to fitting such models including prior specifications. However, to substantially enhance the usefulness of such modelling we propose the notion of a spatially varying LMC (SVLMC) providing a very rich class of multivariate nonstationary processes with simple interpretation. We illustrate the use of our proposed SVLMC with application to more than 600 commercial property transactions in three quite different real estate markets, Chicago, Dallas and San Diego. Bivariate nonstationary process models are developed for income from and selling price of the property.},

In this paper, we develop new methods to construct valid crossvariograms, fit them to data, and then use them for multivariable spatial prediction, including cokriging. Crossvariograms are constructed by explicitly modeling spatial data as moving averages over white noise random processes. Parameters of the moving average functions may be inferred from the variogram, and with few additional parameters, crossvariogram models are constructed. Weighted least squares is then used to fit the crossvariogram model to the empirical crossvariogram for the data. We demonstrate the method for simulated data, and show a considerable advantage of cokriging over ordinary kriging. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

With these new unabridged softcover volumes, Wiley hopes to extend the lives of these works by making them available to future generations of statisticians, mathematicians, and scientists. Spatial statistics-analyzing spatial data through statistical models-has proven exceptionally versatile, encompassing problems ranging from the microscopic to the astronomic. However, for the scientist and engineer faced only with scattered and uneven treatments of the subject in the scientific literature, learning how to make practical use of spatial statistics in day-to-day analytical work is very difficult. Designed exclusively for scientists eager to tap into the enormous potential of this analytical tool and upgrade their range of technical skills, Statistics for Spatial Data is a comprehensive, single-source guide to both the theory and applied aspects of spatial statistical methods. The hard-cover edition was hailed by Mathematical Reviews as an “excellent book which will become a basic reference.” This paper-back edition of the 1993 edition, is designed to meet the many technological challenges facing the scientist and engineer. Concentrating on the three areas of geostatistical data, lattice data, and point patterns, the book sheds light on the link between data and model, revealing how design, inference, and diagnostics are an outgrowth of that link. It then explores new methods to reveal just how spatial statistical models can be used to solve important problems in a host of areas in science and engineering.},

abstract = {The Wiley Classics Library consists of selected books that have been made more accessible to consumers in an effort to increase global appeal and general circulation. With these new unabridged softcover volumes, Wiley hopes to extend the lives of these works by making them available to future generations of statisticians, mathematicians, and scientists. Spatial statistics-analyzing spatial data through statistical models-has proven exceptionally versatile, encompassing problems ranging from the microscopic to the astronomic. However, for the scientist and engineer faced only with scattered and uneven treatments of the subject in the scientific literature, learning how to make practical use of spatial statistics in day-to-day analytical work is very difficult. Designed exclusively for scientists eager to tap into the enormous potential of this analytical tool and upgrade their range of technical skills, Statistics for Spatial Data is a comprehensive, single-source guide to both the theory and applied aspects of spatial statistical methods. The hard-cover edition was hailed by Mathematical Reviews as an “excellent book which will become a basic reference.” This paper-back edition of the 1993 edition, is designed to meet the many technological challenges facing the scientist and engineer. Concentrating on the three areas of geostatistical data, lattice data, and point patterns, the book sheds light on the link between data and model, revealing how design, inference, and diagnostics are an outgrowth of that link. It then explores new methods to reveal just how spatial statistical models can be used to solve important problems in a host of areas in science and engineering.},

abstract = {The relationship between individual and population health is partially built on the broad dichotomization of medicine into clinical medicine and public health. Potential drawbacks of current views include seeing both individual and population health as absolute and independent concepts. I will argue that the relationship between individual and population health is largely relative and dynamic. Their interrelated dynamism derives from a causally defined life course perspective on health determination starting from an individual's conception through growth, development and participation in the collective till death, all seen within the context of an adaptive society. Indeed, it will become clear that neither individual nor population health is identifiable or even definable without informative contextualization within the other. For instance, a person's health cannot be seen in isolation but must be placed in the rich contextual web such as the socioeconomic circumstances and other health determinants of where they were conceived, born, bred, and how they shaped and were shaped by their environment and communities, especially given the prevailing population health exposures over their lifetime. We cannot discuss the "what" and "how much" of individual and population health until we know the cumulative trajectories of both, using appropriate causal language. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2008.},

Considering the fact that health data (and especially genetic data) are considered "sensitive", is there a way to structure the debate on the barriers, and risk-benefit ratio that moves away from the traditional pros and cons of potential privacy and discrimination risks? Potential discrimination has been addressed in legislation and the balancing of privacy rights against the potential benefits of data sharing in intensive science is leading to a more proportionate approach.We postulate that an important catalyst that will further shift this debate from its traditional contours would be to activate the "right to science" as enshrined in international law. Of note, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health has developed a Framework for Responsible Sharing of Genomics and Health-Related Data based on that human right. Similarly, recent guidelines from the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, as well as from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics contain provisions that promote data sharing indicating that data intensive science may gradually come to be founded on a more communal ethos.},

The 2015 UNAIDS statistics shows that newly infected cases of HIV/AIDS has fallen down by 35% since 2000, worldwide. However, the statistics of Fiji tells a different story. The newly infected HIV/AIDS cases in Fiji has been increasing every year since 2000. Different HIV/AIDS awareness programs have been launched previously such as, workshops and seminars. Despite these efforts, there has been no reduction in the newly infected HIV/AIDS cases. Fiji's health sector is still using traditional approaches for building public awareness. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is to explore the benefits of crowdsourcing in developing the social awareness on taboo diseases among Fijians. Data for this study were collected through questionnaire and experimental methods from the people living with HIV as well as from the young Fijians, such as secondary and tertiary students. The result clearly showed that crowdsourcing can be an effective means of assisting Fiji's public health by reaching out to the remote areas, reducing the program costs, and assisting thousands of people simultaneously.},

As COVID-19 proliferated across the United States, Asian Americans reported a surge in racially motivated hate crimes involving physical violence and harassment. Throughout history, pandemic-related health crises have been associated with the stigmatization and “othering” of people of Asian descent. Asian Americans have experienced verbal and physical violence motivated by individual-level racism and xenophobia from the time they arrived in America in the late 1700s up until the present day. At the institutional level, the state has often implicitly reinforced, encouraged, and perpetuated this violence through bigoted rhetoric and exclusionary policies. COVID-19 has enabled the spread of racism and created national insecurity, fear of foreigners, and general xenophobia, which may be related to the increase in anti-Asian hate crimes during the pandemic. We examine how these crimes – situated in historically entrenched and intersecting individual-level and institutional-level racism and xenophobia – have operated to “other” Asian Americans and reproduce inequality.},

@article{Taylor2020,
abstract = {Background: Sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia contributed 81% of 5{\textperiodcentered}9 million under-5 deaths and 77% of 2{\textperiodcentered}6 million stillbirths worldwide in 2015. Vital registration and verbal autopsy data are mainstays for the estimation of leading causes of death, but both are non-specific and focus on a single underlying cause. We aimed to provide granular data on the contributory causes of death in stillborn fetuses and in deceased neonates and children younger than 5 years, to inform child mortality prevention efforts. Methods: The Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) Network was established at sites in seven countries (Baliakandi, Bangladesh; Harar and Kersa, Ethiopia; Siaya and Kisumu, Kenya; Bamako, Mali; Manhi{\c{c}}a, Mozambique; Bombali, Sierra Leone; and Soweto, South Africa) to collect standardised, population-based, longitudinal data on under-5 mortality and stillbirths in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, to improve the accuracy of determining causes of death. Here, we analysed data obtained in the first 2 years after the implementation of CHAMPS at the first five operational sites, during which surveillance and post-mortem diagnostics, including minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS), were used. Data were abstracted from all available clinical records of deceased children, and relevant maternal health records were also extracted for stillbirths and neonatal deaths, to incorporate reported pregnancy or delivery complications. Expert panels followed standardised procedures to characterise causal chains leading to death, including underlying, intermediate (comorbid or antecedent causes), and immediate causes of death for stillbirths, neonatal deaths, and child (age 1–59 months) deaths. Findings: Between Dec 10, 2016, and Dec 31, 2018, MITS procedures were implemented at five sites in Mozambique, South Africa, Kenya, Mali, and Bangladesh. We screened 2385 death notifications for inclusion eligibility, following which 1295 families were approached for consent; consent was provided for MITS by 963 (74%) of 1295 eligible cases approached. At least one cause of death was identified in 912 (98%) of 933 cases (180 stillbirths, 449 neonatal deaths, and 304 child deaths); two or more conditions were identified in the causal chain for 585 (63%) of 933 cases. The most common underlying causes of stillbirth were perinatal asphyxia or hypoxia (130 [72%] of 180 stillbirths) and congenital infection or sepsis (27 [15%]). The most common underlying causes of neonatal death were preterm birth complications (187 [42%] of 449 neonatal deaths), perinatal asphyxia or hypoxia (98 [22%]), and neonatal sepsis (50 [11%]). The most common underlying causes of child deaths were congenital birth defects (39 [13%] of 304 deaths), lower respiratory infection (37 [12%]), and HIV (35 [12%]). In 503 (54%) of 933 cases, at least one contributory pathogen was identified. Cytomegalovirus, Escherichia coli, group B Streptococcus, and other infections contributed to 30 (17%) of 180 stillbirths. Among neonatal deaths with underlying prematurity, 60% were precipitated by other infectious causes. Of the 275 child deaths with infectious causes, the most common contributory pathogens were Klebsiella pneumoniae (86 [31%]), Streptococcus pneumoniae (54 [20%]), HIV (40 [15%]), and cytomegalovirus (34 [12%]), and multiple infections were common. Lower respiratory tract infection contributed to 174 (57%) of 304 child deaths. Interpretation: Cause of death determination using MITS enabled detailed characterisation of contributing conditions. Global estimates of child mortality aetiologies, which are currently based on a single syndromic cause for each death, will be strengthened by findings from CHAMPS. This approach adds specificity and provides a more complete overview of the chain of events leading to death, highlighting multiple potential interventions to prevent under-5 mortality and stillbirths.

@incollection{Holmes2017,
abstract = {Infectious diseases were responsible for the largest global burden of premature death and disability until the end of the twentieth century, when that distinction passed to noncommunicable diseases. Over the previous centuries, global pandemics of infectious diseases, such as smallpox, cholera, and influenza, periodically threatened the survival of entire populations. At least as early as the late 1800s, improved living conditions (such as better sanitation and piped water supplies), particularly in high-income countries (HICs), began to drive down the infectious disease burden. By the mid-twentieth century, safe, effective, and affordable vaccines and the increasing availability of antibiotics had further reduced the toll of infectious diseases in HICs. Not until the second half of the twentieth century did large-scale efforts begin to better control infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where the infectious disease burden was greatest and highly varied. These efforts included a global commitment to immunize the world's children against the major infections for which vaccines are available and global campaigns to control malaria and diarrheal disease. The International Health Regulations of the World Health Organization (WHO) represent a key agreement among 196 countries to implement metrics and measures to detect and control outbreaks of infectious diseases and to prevent pandemics (World Health Assembly 2005). Global under-five mortality fell by almost two-thirds (from 14 percent to 5 percent) between 1970 and 2010 (Norheim and others 2015). In 1980, smallpox, responsible for 300 million–500 million deaths in the twentieth century, was declared to be the first disease eradicated from the planet following a global immunization campaign led by the WHO. Wild Poliovirus has been eliminated from all but three countries (Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan) and currently is the focus of a major eradication program. The decline of the vaccine-preventable diseases has contributed to a recognition of the potential for using vaccines to prevent other infectious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), tuberculosis (TB), malaria, hepatitis C, and a variety of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Hepatitis B and C substantially increase the risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer. The effect of viral hepatitis is significant. Indeed, an important recent study (Stanaway and others 2015) found that viral hepatitis led to an estimated 0.9 million deaths in 1990 (including hepatitis-caused deaths from cirrhosis and liver cancer). Furthermore, this number has been increasing rapidly—to an estimated 1.5 million deaths in 2013—despite the fact that hepatitis B is a vaccine-preventable disease and that hepatitis B and C are both treatable. Emerging pandemic viral infections remain a constant threat, many entering the human population from contact with animals. The most recent such infections include SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), and Ebola and Zika viruses (Madhav and others 2018) as well as, perennially, influenza and chikungunya infections. Compared with antibiotics to treat bacterial infections, relatively few antiviral drugs have been developed to treat these emerging viral infections. Therefore, the most important intervention is to break the chain of transmission. A global increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria includes a small but growing number that are resistant to most or essentially all of the available antimicrobials. Spectacular progress has been made in reducing mortality from most infectious diseases (table 1.1). For example, in low-income countries (LICs) from 2000 to 2010, the number of deaths before age 70 years from HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria fell by 46 percent, 35 percent, and 36 percent, respectively (Norheim and others 2015). Rapid progress was also reported in other country income groups. However, table 1.1 shows also that if the death rates of 2010 remain static, about 5.1 million people will still die in 2030 from these three conditions and from other communicable diseases, many of which are concentrated in LMICs. In contrast, mortality in HICs from these conditions (except for HIV/AIDS) will be relatively small, although major pandemics of other pathogens are not predictable. Hence, infectious diseases will remain a major threat to humankind, especially in LMICs, requiring vigilance, surveillance, and new interventions of all types.},

abstract = {Introduction Since March 2020, when the COVID-19 outbreak has been deemed a pandemic by the WHO, the SARS-CoV-2 spreading has been the focus of attention of scientists, authorities, public health agencies and communities around the world. One of the great concerns and challenges, mainly in low-income and middle-income countries, is the identification and monitoring of COVID-19 cases. The large-scale availability of testing is a fundamental aspect of COVID-19 control, but it is currently the biggest challenge faced by many countries around the world. We aimed to synthesise and critically evaluate the scientific evidence on the influence of the testing capacity for symptomatic individuals in the control of COVID-19. Methods and analysis A systematic review will be conducted in eight databases, such as Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, ISI-of-Knowledge, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, SCOPUS, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, PsycINFO and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, from inception to 30 July 2020. No restriction regarding the language, publication date or setting will be employed. Primary outcomes will include the sensitivity as well as the specificity of the tests for COVID-19. Study selection will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. Methodological assessment of the studies will be evaluated by the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool for randomised controlled trials, the MINORS for non-randomised studies and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort or case-control studies. Findings will be structured according to the test type and target population characteristics and focused on the primary outcomes (sensitivity and specificity). Moreover, if sufficient data are available, a meta-analysis will be performed. Pooled standardised mean differences and 95% CIs will be calculated. Heterogeneity between the studies will be determined by I 2 statistics. Subgroup analyses will also be conducted. Publication bias will be assessed with funnel plots and Egger's test. Heterogeneity will be explored by random effects analysis. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required. The results will be disseminated widely via peer-reviewed publication and presentations at conferences related to this field. PROSPERO registration number CRD42020182724.},

In western India, government-collected daily mortality registry data were obtained from five cities, along with daily hospital admissions data from three government hospitals in Ahmedabad. In Nepal, individual-level data on hospital admissions were collected from six major hospitals in Kathmandu Valley. Our process illustrates many challenges for researchers, governments, and record keepers inherent to data collection in developing countries: creating and maintaining a centralized record-keeping system; standardizing the data collected; obtaining data from some local agencies; assuring data completeness and availability of back-ups to the datasets; as well as translating, cleaning, and comparing data within and across localities. We suggest that these "small-data" resources may better serve the analysis of health outcomes than exposure-response functions extrapolated from data collected in other areas of the world.},

abstract = {Background: National and subnational level surveys are important for monitoring disease burden, prioritizing resource allocation, and evaluating public health policies. As mobile phone access and ownership become more common globally, mobile phone surveys (MPSs) offer an opportunity to supplement traditional public health household surveys. Objective: The objective of this study was to systematically review the current landscape of MPSs to collect population-level estimates in low-And middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods: Primary and gray literature from 7 online databases were systematically searched for studies that deployed MPSs to collect population-level estimates. Titles and abstracts were screened on primary inclusion and exclusion criteria by two research assistants. Articles that met primary screening requirements were read in full and screened for secondary eligibility criteria. Articles included in review were grouped into the following three categories by their survey modality: (1) interactive voice response (IVR), (2) short message service (SMS), and (3) human operator or computer-Assisted telephone interviews (CATI). Data were abstracted by two research assistants. The conduct and reporting of the review conformed to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Results: A total of 6625 articles were identified through the literature review. Overall, 11 articles were identified that contained 19 MPS (CATI, IVR, or SMS) surveys to collect population-level estimates across a range of topics. MPSs were used in Latin America (n=8), the Middle East (n=1), South Asia (n=2), and sub-Saharan Africa (n=8). Nine articles presented results for 10 CATI surveys (10/19, 53%). Two articles discussed the findings of 6 IVR surveys (6/19, 32%). Three SMS surveys were identified from 2 articles (3/19, 16%). Approximately 63% (12/19) of MPS were delivered to mobile phone numbers collected from previously administered household surveys. The majority of MPS (11/19, 58%) were panel surveys where a cohort of participants, who often were provided a mobile phone upon a face-To-face enrollment, were surveyed multiple times. Conclusions: Very few reports of population-level MPS were identified. Of the MPS that were identified, the majority of surveys were conducted using CATI. Due to the limited number of identified IVR and SMS surveys, the relative advantages and disadvantages among the three survey modalities cannot be adequately assessed. The majority of MPS were sent to mobile phone numbers that were collected from a previously administered household survey. There is limited evidence on whether a random digit dialing (RDD) approach or a simple random sample of mobile network provided list of numbers can produce a population representative survey.},

abstract = {The velocity, volume, and variety of big data present both challenges and opportunities for cognitive science. We introduce sequential Bayesian updating as a tool to mine these three core properties. In the Bayesian approach, we summarize the current state of knowledge regarding parameters in terms of their posterior distributions, and use these as prior distributions when new data become available. Crucially, we construct posterior distributions in such a way that we avoid having to repeat computing the likelihood of old data as new data become available, allowing the propagation of information without great computational demand. As a result, these Bayesian methods allow continuous inference on voluminous information streams in a timely manner. We illustrate the advantages of sequential Bayesian updating with data from the MindCrowd project, in which crowd-sourced data are used to study Alzheimer's Dementia. We fit an extended Linear Approach to Threshold with Ergodic Rate model to reaction time data from the project in order to separate two distinct aspects of cognitive functioning: speed of information accumulation and caution. 2.1 Introduction The big data era offers multiple sources of data, with measurements that contain a variety of information in large volumes. For example, neuroimaging data from a participant might be complemented with a battery of personality tests and a set of cognitive-behavioral data. At the same time, with brain imaging equipment more widely accessible the number of participants is unlikely to remain limited to a handful per study. These advancements allow us to investigate cognitive phenomena from various angles, and the synthesis of these perspectives requires highly complex models. Cognitive science is slated to update its set of methods to foster a more sophisticated, systematic study of human cognition. Cognitive science has traditionally relied on explicative models to summarize observed data. Even simple cognitive measurement models (such as, e.g., process dissociation) are non-linear and can capture complex processes in more interesting terms than additive elements of true score and noise (such as in regression). With more complex cognitive process models (e.g., Ratcliff, 1978) we can study underlying mechanisms in meaningful terms and extract important facets of cognitive functioning from raw behavioral data. In this chapter, we focus on methods that can be used for predominantly model-driven statistical inference. Here we use model-driven as a distinctive term, to separate these methods from the largely data-driven ones, such as those in machine learning (for Bayesian methods in machine learning see Zhu, Chen, & Hu, 2014). In practice, the specifics of a research question, together with relevant domain knowledge, will inform the choice of methods. Our purpose is not to advocate one set of methods over the other, but to offer by example an insight into what model-driven methods can achieve. In particular, we will focus on how Bayesian methods can be employed to perform model-driven inference for big data in an efficient and statistically coherent manner. The primary reasoning behind considering model-based inference lies in the fact that big data is often voluminous in both length (number of units, e.g., people) and width (number of variables, e.g., cognitive measures). While increases in computing power can help data-driven exploration, this doubly exponential problem of 'thick' datasets often calls for domain-specific expertise.

We thus develop space-time estimation and prediction methods in the presence of missing data, through the Kalman filter, in order to obtain accurate estimates of model parameters and reliable space-time predictions.

@article{Wikle1998,
abstract = {Space-time data are ubiquitous in the environmental sciences. Often, as is the case with atmospheric and oceanographic processes, these data contain many different scales of spatial and temporal variability. Such data are often non-stationary in space and time and may involve many observation/prediction locations. These factors can limit the effectiveness of traditional space-time statistical models and methods. In this article, we propose the use of hierarchical space-time models to achieve more flexible models and methods for the analysis of environmental data distributed in space and time. The first stage of the hierarchical model specifies a measurement-error process for the observational data in terms of some 'state' process. The second stage allows for site-specific time series models for this state variable. This stage includes large-scale (e.g. seasonal) variability plus a space-time dynamic process for the 'anomalies'. Much of our interest is with this anomaly process. In the third stage, the parameters of these time series models, which are distributed in space, are themselves given a joint distribution with spatial dependence (Markov random fields). The Bayesian formulation is completed in the last two stages by specifying priors on parameters. We implement the model in a Markov chain Monte Carlo framework and apply it to an atmospheric data set of monthly maximum temperature.},

abstract = {This article deals with jointly modeling a large number of geographically referenced outcomes observed over a very large number of locations. We seek to capture associations among the variables as well as the strength of spatial association for each variable. In addition, we reckon with the common setting where not all the variables have been observed over all locations, which leads to spatial misalignment. Dimension reduction is needed in two aspects: (i) the length of the vector of outcomes, and (ii) the very large number of spatial locations. Latent variable (factor) models are usually used to address the former, although low-rank spatial processes offer a rich and flexible modeling option for dealing with a large number of locations. We merge these two ideas to propose a class of hierarchical low-rank spatial factor models. Our framework pursues stochastic selection of the latent factors without resorting to complex computational strategies (such as reversible jump algorithms) by utilizing certain identifiability characterizations for the spatial factor model. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is developed for estimation that also deals with the spatial misalignment problem. We recover the full posterior distribution of the missing values (along with model parameters) in a Bayesian predictive framework. Various additional modeling and implementation issues are discussed as well. We illustrate our methodology with simulation experiments and an environmental data set involving air pollutants in California. {\textcopyright} 2013, The International Biometric Society.},

abstract = {Electronic health records (EHRs) present a wealth of data that are vital for improving patient-centered outcomes, although the data can present significant statistical challenges. In particular, EHR data contains substantial missing information that if left unaddressed could reduce the validity of conclusions drawn. Properly addressing the missing data issue in EHR data is complicated by the fact that it is sometimes difficult to differentiate between missing data and a negative value. For example, a patient without a documented history of heart failure may truly not have disease or the clinician may have simply not documented the condition. Approaches for reducing missing data in EHR systems come from multiple angles, including: increasing structured data documentation, reducing data input errors, and utilization of text parsing / natural language processing. This paper focuses on the analytical approaches for handling missing data, primarily multiple imputation. The broad range of variables available in typical EHR systems provide a wealth of information for mitigating potential biases caused by missing data. The probability of missing data may be linked to disease severity and healthcare utilization since unhealthier patients are more likely to have comorbidities and each interaction with the health care system provides an opportunity for documentation. Therefore, any imputation routine should include predictor variables that assess overall health status (e.g. Charlson Comorbidity Index) and healthcare utilization (e.g. number of encounters) even when these comorbidities and patient encounters are unrelated to the disease of interest. Linking the EHR data with other sources of information (e.g. National Death Index and census data) can also provide less biased variables for imputation. Additional methodological research with EHR data and improved epidemiological training of clinical investigators is warranted.},

For decades, the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach has been a common method of handling missing data. Considerable advances in statistical methodology and our ability to implement those methods have been made in recent years. Thus, it is appropriate to reconsider analytic approaches for longitudinal data. This review examines the following from a clinical perspective: 1) the characteristics of missing data that influence analytic choices; 2) the attributes of common methods of handling missing data; and 3) the use of the data characteristics and the attributes of the various methods, along with empirical evidence, to develop a robust approach for the analysis and interpretation of data from longitudinal clinical trials. We propose that, in many settings, the primary efficacy analysis should use a repeated measures, likelihood-based, mixed-effects modeling approach, with LOCF used as a secondary, composite measure of efficacy, safety, and tolerability. We illustrate how repeated-measures analyses can be used to enhance decision-making, and we review the caveats that remain regarding the use of LOCF as a composite measure. {\textcopyright} 2003 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {Valid analyses of longitudinal data can be problematic, particularly when subjects dropout prior to completing the trial for reasons related to the outcome. Regulatory agencies often favor the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach for imputing missing values in the primary analysis of clinical trials. However, recent evidence suggests that likelihood-based analyses developed under the missing at random framework provide viable alternatives. The within-subject error correlation structure is often the means by which such methods account for the bias from missing data. The objective of this study was to extend previous work that used only one correlation structure by including several common correlation structures in order to assess the effect of the correlation structure in the data, and how it is modeled, on Type I error rates and power from a likelihood-based repeated measures analysis (MMRM), using LOCF for comparison. Data from four realistic clinical trial scenarios were simulated using autoregressive, compound symmetric and unstructured correlation structures. When the correct correlation structure was fit, MMRM provided better control of Type I error and power than LOCF. Although misfitting the correlation structure in MMRM inflated Type I error and altered power, misfitting the structure was typically less deleterious than using LOCF. In fact, simply specifying an unstructured matrix for use in MMRM, regardless of the true correlation structure, yielded superior control of Type I error than LOCF in every scenario. The present and previous investigations have shown that the bias in LOCF is influenced by several factors and interactions between them. Hence, it is difficult to precisely anticipate the direction and magnitude of bias from LOCF in practical situations. However, in scenarios where the overall tendency is for patient improvement, LOCF tends to: 1) overestimate a drug's advantage when dropout is higher in the comparator and underestimate the advantage when dropout is lower in the comparator; 2) overestimate a drug's advantage when the advantage is maximum at intermediate time points and underestimate the advantage when the advantage increases over time; and 3) have a greater likelihood of overestimating a drug's advantage when the advantage is small. In scenarios in which the overall tendency is for patient worsening, the above biases are reversed.

abstract = {Many physical/biological processes involve variability over both space and time. As a result of difficulties caused by large datasets and the modelling of space, time and spatio-temporal interactions, traditional space-time methods are limited. In this paper, we present an approach to space-time prediction that achieves dimension reduction and uses a statistical model that is temporally dynamic and spatially descriptive. That is, it exploits the unidirectional flow of time, in an autoregressive framework, and is spatially 'descriptive' in that the autoregressive process is spatially coloured. With the inclusion of a measurement equation, this formulation naturally leads to the development of a spatio-temporal Kalman filter that achieves dimension reduction in the analysis of large spatio-temporal datasets. Unlike other recent space-time Kalman filters, our model also allows a non-dynamic spatial component. The method is applied to a dataset of near-surface winds over the topical Pacific ocean. Spatial predictions with this dataset are improved by considering the additional non-dynamic spatial process. The improvement becomes more pronounced as the signal-to-noise ratio decreases. {\textcopyright} 1999 Biometrika Trust.},

Keeping all this in mind, this article is written after various studies and analysis on the latest data on COVID19 spread, which also includes the demographic and environmental factors. After gathering data from various resources, all data is integrated and passed into different Machine Learning Models in order to check its appropriateness. Ensemble Learning Technique, Random Forest, gives a good evaluation score on the tested data. Through this technique, various important factors are recognized and their contribution to the spread is analyzed. Also, linear relationships between various features are plotted through the heat map of Pearson Correlation matrix. Finally, Kalman Filter is used to estimate future spread of SARS-Cov-2, which shows good results on the tested data. The inferences from the Random Forest feature importance and Pearson Correlation gives many similarities and few dissimilarities, and these techniques successfully identify the different contributing factors. The Kalman Filter gives a satisfying result for short term estimation, but not so good performance for long term forecasting. Overall, the analysis, plots, inferences and forecast are satisfying and can help a lot in fighting the spread of the virus.},

These estimates are of great public health interest, as evidenced during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus pandemic. We reviewed methods commonly used to estimate R0, examined their practical utility, and assessed how estimates of this epidemiological parameter can inform mitigation strategy decisions. In isolation, R0 is a suboptimal gauge of infectious disease dynamics across populations; other disease parameters may provide more useful information. Nonetheless, estimation of R0 for a particular population is useful for understanding transmission in the study population.

@article{Datta2012,
abstract = {The need for small area estimates is increasingly felt in both the public and private sectors in order to formulate their strategic plans. It is now widely recognized that direct small area survey estimates are highly unreliable owing to large standard errors and coefficients of variation. The reason behind this is that a survey is usually designed to achieve a specified level of accuracy at a higher level of geography than that of small areas. Lack of additional resources makes it almost imperative to use the same data to produce small area estimates. For example, if a survey is designed to estimate per capita income for a state, the same survey data need to be used to produce similar estimates for counties, subcounties and census divisions within that state. Thus, by necessity, small area estimation needs explicit, or at least implicit, use of models to link these areas. Improved small area estimates are found by "borrowing strength" from similar neighboring areas. The key to small area estimation is shrinkage of direct estimates toward some regression estimates obtained by using in addition administrative records and other available sources of information. These shrinkage estimates can often be motivated from both a Bayesian and a frequentist point of view, and indeed in this particular context, it is possible to obtain at least an operational synthesis between the two paradigms. Thus, on one hand, while small area estimates can be developed using a hierarchical Bayesian or an empirical Bayesian approach, similar estimates are also found using the theory of best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) or empirical best linear unbiased prediction (EBLUP). The present article discusses primarily normal theory-based small area estimation techniques, and attempts a synthesis between both the Bayesian and the frequentist points of view. The results are mostly discussed for random effects models and their hierarchical Bayesian counterparts. A few miscellaneous remarks are made at the end describing the current research for more complex models including some nonnormal ones. Also provided are some pointers for future research. {\textcopyright} 2012 Institute of Mathematical Statistics.},

abstract = {A key issue to address in synthesizing spatial data with variable-support in spatial analysis and modeling is the change-of-support problem. We present an approach for solving the change-of-support and variable-support data fusion problems. This approach is based on geostatistical inverse modeling that explicitly accounts for differences in spatial support. The inverse model is applied here to produce both the best predictions of a target support and prediction uncertainties, based on one or more measurements, while honoring measurements. Spatial data covering large geographic areas often exhibit spatial nonstationarity and can lead to computational challenge due to the large data size. We developed a local-window geostatistical inverse modeling approach to accommodate these issues of spatial nonstationarity and alleviate computational burden. We conducted experiments using synthetic and real-world raster data. Synthetic data were generated and aggregated to multiple supports and downscaled back to the original support to analyze the accuracy of spatial predictions and the correctness of prediction uncertainties. Similar experiments were conducted for real-world raster data. Real-world data with variable-support were statistically fused to produce single-support predictions and associated uncertainties. The modeling results demonstrate that geostatistical inverse modeling can produce accurate predictions and associated prediction uncertainties. It is shown that the local-window geostatistical inverse modeling approach suggested offers a practical way to solve the well-known change-of-support problem and variable-support data fusion problem in spatial analysis and modeling.},

The change of support problem is concerned with inference about the values of a variable at points or blocks different from those at which it has been observed. In the context of block data which can be sensibly viewed as averaging over point data, we propose a unifying approach for prediction from points to points, points to blocks, blocks to points, and blocks to blocks. The approach includes fully Bayesian kriging. We also extend our approach to the the case of spatio-temporal data, wherein a judicious specification of spatio-temporal association enables manageable computation. Exemplification of the static spatial case is provided using a dataset of point-level ozone measurements in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area. The dynamic spatial case is illustrated using a temporally extended version of this dataset, enabling comparison at the common time point.},

abstract = {Background: The medical, societal, and economic impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has unknown effects on overall population mortality. Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom thus far have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high-risk conditions or their longer-term baseline (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence scenarios based on varying levels of transmission suppression and differing mortality impacts based on different relative risks for the disease. Methods: In this population-based cohort study, we used linked primary and secondary care electronic health records from England (Health Data Research UK–CALIBER). We report prevalence of underlying conditions defined by Public Health England guidelines (from March 16, 2020) in individuals aged 30 years or older registered with a practice between 1997 and 2017, using validated, openly available phenotypes for each condition. We estimated 1-year mortality in each condition, developing simple models (and a tool for calculation) of excess COVID-19-related deaths, assuming relative impact (as relative risks [RRs]) of the COVID-19 pandemic (compared with background mortality) of 1{\textperiodcentered}5, 2{\textperiodcentered}0, and 3{\textperiodcentered}0 at differing infection rate scenarios, including full suppression (0{\textperiodcentered}001%), partial suppression (1%), mitigation (10%), and do nothing (80%). We also developed an online, public, prototype risk calculator for excess death estimation. Findings: We included 3 862 012 individuals (1 957 935 [50{\textperiodcentered}7%] women and 1 904 077 [49{\textperiodcentered}3%] men). We estimated that more than 20% of the study population are in the high-risk category, of whom 13{\textperiodcentered}7% were older than 70 years and 6{\textperiodcentered}3% were aged 70 years or younger with at least one underlying condition. 1-year mortality in the high-risk population was estimated to be 4{\textperiodcentered}46% (95% CI 4{\textperiodcentered}41–4{\textperiodcentered}51). Age and underlying conditions combined to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions. In a full suppression scenario in the UK population, we estimated that there would be two excess deaths (vs baseline deaths) with an RR of 1{\textperiodcentered}5, four with an RR of 2{\textperiodcentered}0, and seven with an RR of 3{\textperiodcentered}0. In a mitigation scenario, we estimated 18 374 excess deaths with an RR of 1{\textperiodcentered}5, 36 749 with an RR of 2{\textperiodcentered}0, and 73 498 with an RR of 3{\textperiodcentered}0. In a do nothing scenario, we estimated 146 996 excess deaths with an RR of 1{\textperiodcentered}5, 293 991 with an RR of 2{\textperiodcentered}0, and 587 982 with an RR of 3{\textperiodcentered}0. Interpretation: We provide policy makers, researchers, and the public a simple model and an online tool for understanding excess mortality over 1 year from the COVID-19 pandemic, based on age, sex, and underlying condition-specific estimates. These results signal the need for sustained stringent suppression measures as well as sustained efforts to target those at highest risk because of underlying conditions with a range of preventive interventions. Countries should assess the overall (direct and indirect) effects of the pandemic on excess mortality.

Despite the burden of injury sustained by LMIC, there are few continuing injury surveillance systems for collection and analysis of injury data. We describe a hospital-based trauma surveillance instrument for collection of a minimum data-set for calculating common injury scoring metrics including the Abbreviated Injury Scale and the Injury Severity Score. The Cape Town Trauma Registry (CTTR) is designed for injury surveillance in low-resource settings. A pilot at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town was conducted for one month to demonstrate the feasibility of systematic data collection and analysis, and to explore challenges of implementing a trauma registry in a LMIC. Key characteristics of the CTTR include: Ability to calculate injury severity, key minimal data elements, expansion to include quality indicators and minimal drain on human resources based on few fields. The CTTR provides a strategy to describe the distribution and consequences of injury in a high trauma volume, low-resource environment. {\textcopyright} 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Methods and Findings 7,290 participants recorded characteristics of 97,904 contacts with different individuals during one day, including age, sex, location, duration, frequency, and occurrence of physical contact. We found that mixing patterns and contact characteristics were remarkably similar across different European countries. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age: schoolchildren and young adults in particular tended to mix with people of the same age. Contacts lasting at least one hour or occurring on a daily basis mostly involved physical contact, while short duration and infrequent contacts tended to be nonphysical. Contacts at home, school, or leisure were more likely to be physical than contacts at the workplace or while travelling. Preliminary modelling indicates that 5-to 19-year-olds are expected to suffer the highest incidence during the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection transmitted through social contacts measured here when the population is completely susceptible. Conclusions To our knowledge, our study provides the first large-scale quantitative approach to contact patterns relevant for infections transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route, and the results should lead to improved parameterisation of mathematical models used to design control strategies.},

We analysed data for 2000–14 from the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS) in Uganda, where free ART was scaled up after 2004. Using non-parametric and parametric (Weibull) survival analysis, we estimated trends in average person-years lived between exact ages 15 and 50, per capita life-years lost to HIV, and the mortality hazards of people living with HIV (PLHIV). Between 2000 and 2014, average adult life-years lived before age 50 increased significantly, from 26.4 to 33.5 years for all women and from 28.6 to 33.8 years for all men. As of 2014, life-years lost to HIV had declined significantly, to 1.3 years among women and 0.4 years among men. Following the roll-out of ART, mortality reductions among PLHIV were initially larger in women than men, but this is no longer the case.},

abstract = {Background: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) result in more deaths globally than other causes. Monitoring systems require strengthening to attribute the NCD burden and deaths in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Data from health and demographic surveillance systems (HDSS) can contribute towards this goal. Methods and Findings: Between 2003 and 2010, 15,228 deaths in adults aged 15 years (y) and older were identified retrospectively using the HDSS census and verbal autopsy in rural western Kenya, attributed into broad categories using InterVA-4 computer algorithms; 37% were ascribed to NCDs, 60% to communicable diseases (CDs), 3% to injuries, and ,1% maternal causes. Median age at death for NCDs was 66y and 71y for females and males, respectively, with 43% (39% male, 48% female) of NCD deaths occurring prematurely among adults aged below 65y. NCD deaths were mainly attributed to cancers (35%) and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs; 29%). The proportionate mortality from NCDs rose from 35% in 2003 to 45% in 2010 (x2 linear trend 93.4; p,0.001). While overall annual mortality rates (MRs) for NCDs fell, cancer-specific MRs rose from 200 to 262 per 100,000 population, mainly due to increasing deaths in adults aged 65y and older, and to respiratory neoplasms in all age groups. The substantial fall in CD MRs resulted in similar MRs for CDs and NCDs among all adult females by 2010. NCD MRs for adults aged 15y to ,65y fell from 409 to 183 per 100,000 among females and from 517 to 283 per 100,000 population among males. NCD MRs were higher among males than females aged both below, and at or above, 65y.},

To investigate their effects on the disease spreading, we propose a pairwise epidemic model with infection age and demography on dynamic networks. The basic reproduction number of this model is derived. It is proved that there is a disease-free equilibrium which is globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is less that unity. Besides, sensitivity analysis is performed and shows that increasing the variance in recovery time and decreasing the variance in infection time can effectively control the diseases. The complex interaction between the death rate and equilibrium prevalence suggests that it is imperative to correctly estimate the parameters of demography in order to assess the disease transmission dynamics accurately. Moreover, numerical simulations show that the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable.},

We propose that the explanation lies in the nature of the urban particulate cloud, which may contain up to 100000 nanometer-sized particles per mL, in what may be a gravimetric concentration of only 100-200 $\mu$g/m3 of pollutant. We suggest that such ultra-fine particles are able to provoke alveolar inflammation, with release of mediators capable, in susceptible individuals, of causing exacerbations of lung disease and of increasing blood coagulability, thus also explaining the observed increases in cardiovascular deaths associated with urban pollution episodes.

The classification of individuals into smaller units, which in turn are grouped into larger units, can induce contextual effects. On the other hand, a scaling effect can occur due to the aggregation of data from smaller units into larger units. In this paper, we propose a shared multilevel model to address the contextual effects. In addition, we consider a shared multiscale model to adjust for both scale and contextual effects simultaneously. We also study convolution and independent multiscale models, which are special cases of shared multilevel and shared multiscale models, respectively. We compare the performance of the models by applying them to real and simulated data sets. We found that the shared multiscale model was the best model across a range of simulated and real scenarios as measured by the deviance information criterion (DIC) and the Watanabe Akaike information criterion (WAIC).},

abstract = {UNAIDS and country analysts use a simple infectious disease model, embedded in the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP), to generate annual updates on the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. Our objective was to develop modifications to the current model that improve fit to recently observed prevalence trends across countries. Our proposed alternative to the current EPP approach simplifies the model structure and explicitly models changes in average infection risk over time, operationalised using penalised B-splines in a Bayesian framework. We also present an alternative approach to initiating the epidemic that improves standardisation and efficiency, and add an informative prior distribution for changes in infection risk beyond the last data point that enhances the plausibility of short-term extrapolations. The spline-based model produces better fits than the current model to observed prevalence trends in settings that have recently experienced levelling or rising prevalence following a steep decline, such as Uganda and urban Rwanda. The model also predicts a deceleration of the decline in prevalence for countries with recent experience of steady declines, such as Kenya and Zimbabwe. Estimates and projections from our alternative model are comparable to those from the current model where the latter performs well. A more flexible epidemiological model that accommodates changing infection risk over time can provide better estimates and short-term projections of HIV/AIDS incidence, prevalence and mortality than the current EPP model. The alternative model specification can be incorporated easily into existing analytical tools that are used to produce updates on the global HIV/AIDS epidemic.},

Results show that a two-component concomitant variable Poisson mixture regression model predicts heart disease better than both the standard Poisson mixture regression model and the ordinary general linear Poisson regression model due to its low Bayesian Information Criteria value. Furthermore, a Zero Inflated Poisson Mixture Regression model turned out to be the best model for heart prediction over all models as it both clusters individuals into high or low risk category and predicts rate to heart disease componentwise given clusters available. It is deduced that heart disease prediction can be effectively done by identifying the major risks componentwise using Poisson mixture regression model.},

The motivations for this include: investigation of similarities or dissimilarities in the risk distribution for the different diseases, as well as 'borrowing strength' across disease rates to shrink the uncertainty in geographical risk assessment for any particular disease. A number of approaches to such multivariate modelling have been suggested and this paper proposes an extension to these which may provide a richer range of dependency structures than those encompassed so far. We develop a model which incorporates a discrete mixture of latent structures and argue that this provides potential to represent an enhanced range of correlation structures between diseases at the same time as implicitly allowing for less restrictive spatial correlation structures between geographical units. We compare and contrast our approach to other commonly used multivariate disease models and demonstrate comparative results using data taken from cancer registries on four carcinomas in some 300 geographical units in England, Scotland and Wales.},

In this paper, we describe a semiparametric space-time model from a Bayesian perspective. Nonlinear time dependence of covariates and the interactions among the covariates are constructed by local linear and piecewise linear models, allowing for more flexible orientation and position of the covariate plane by using time-varying basis functions. Space-varying covariate linkage coefficients are also incorporated to allow for the variation of space structures across the geographical location. The formulation accommodates uncertainty in the number and locations of the piecewise basis functions to characterize the global effects, spatially structured and unstructured random effects in relation to covariates. The proposed approach relies on variable selection-type mixture priors for uncertainty in the number and locations of basis functions and in the space-varying linkage coefficients. A simulation example is presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach with the competing models.

This however did not prevent further rapid spread of BTV-8 across Northern Europe. Using information on the 2006 Bluetongue outbreak in cattle farms in Belgium, a spatio-temporal transmission model was formulated. The model quantifies the local transmission of the disease between farms within a municipality, the short-distance transmission between farms across neighbouring municipalities and the transmission as a result of cattle movement. Different municipality-level covariates such as farm density, land composition variables, temperature and precipitation, were assessed as possibly influencing each component of the transmission process. Results showed a significant influence of the different covariates in each model component, particularly the significant effect of temperature and precipitation values in the number of infected farms. The model which allowed us to predict the dynamic spreading of BTV for different movement restriction scenarios, also affirmed the significant impact of cattle movement in the 2006 BTV outbreak pattern. Simulation results further showed the importance of considering the size of restriction zones in the formulation of guidelines for animal infectious diseases. {\textcopyright} 2013 Ensoy et al.},

Methods: Spatiotemporal scan technique was applied to identify the high risk region of DF. Multiple regression model was used to identify the socio-environmental factors associated with DF infection. A Poisson regression model was employed to examine the spatiotemporal patterns in the spread of DF. Results: Spatial clusters of DF were primarily concentrated at the southwest part of Guangzhou city. Age group (65+ years) (Odd Ratio (OR) = 1.49, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.13 to 2.03), floating population (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.15), low-education (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.16) and non-agriculture (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.11) were associated with DF transmission. Poisson regression results indicated that changes in DF incidence rates were significantly associated with longitude ($\beta$ = -5.08, P<0.01) and latitude ($\beta$ = -1.99, P<0.01). Conclusions: The study demonstrated that social-environmental factors may play an important role in DF transmission in Guangzhou. As geographic range of notified DF has significantly expanded over recent years, an early warning systems based on spatiotemporal model with socio-environmental is urgently needed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of dengue control and prevention.},

abstract = {The current survey paper concerns stochastic mathematical models for the spread of infectious diseases. It starts with the simplest setting of a homogeneous population in which a transmittable disease spreads during a short outbreak. Assuming a large population some important features are presented: branching process approximation, basic reproduction number R 0 , and final size of an outbreak. Some extensions towards realism are then discussed: models for endemic-ity, various heterogeneities, and prior immmunity. The focus is then shifted to statistical inference. What can be estimated for these models for various levels of detailed data and with what precision? The paper ends by describing how the inference results may be used for determining successful vaccination strategies. This paper will appear as a chapter of a forthcoming book entitled Handbook of Infectious Disease Epidemiology.},

abstract = {Agent-based models are a tool that can be used to better understand the dynamics of an infectious disease outbreak. An infectious disease outbreak is influenced by many factors including vaccination or immunity levels, population density, and the age structure of the population. We hypothesize that these factors along with interactions of factors and the actions of individuals would lead to outbreaks of different size and severity even in two towns that appear similar on paper. Thus, it is necessary to implement a model that is able to capture these interactions and the actions of individuals. Using openly available data we create a data-driven agent-based model to simulate the spread of an airborne infectious disease in an Irish town. Agent-based models have been known to produce results that include the emergence of patterns and behaviours that are not directly programmed into the model. Our model is tested by simulating an outbreak of measles that occurred in Schull, Ireland in 2012. We simulate the same outbreak in 33 different towns and look at the correlations between the model results and the town characteristics (population, area, vaccination rates, age structure) to determine if the results of the model are affected by interactions of those town characteristics and the decisions on the agents in the model. As expected our results show that the outbreaks are not strongly correlated with any of the main characteristics of the towns and thus the model is most likely capturing such interactions and the agent-based model is successful in capturing the differences in the outbreaks.},

@article{Ferguson,
abstract = {The global impact of COVID-19 has been profound, and the public health threat it represents is the most serious seen in a respiratory virus since the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Here we present the results of epidemiological modelling which has informed policymaking in the UK and other countries in recent weeks. In the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, we assess the potential role of a number of public health measures-so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)-aimed at reducing contact rates in the population and thereby reducing transmission of the virus. In the results presented here, we apply a previously published microsimulation model to two countries: the UK (Great Britain specifically) and the US. We conclude that the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is likely to be limited, requiring multiple interventions to be combined to have a substantial impact on transmission. Two fundamental strategies are possible: (a) mitigation, which focuses on slowing but not necessarily stopping epidemic spread-reducing peak healthcare demand while protecting those most at risk of severe disease from infection, and (b) suppression, which aims to reverse epidemic growth, reducing case numbers to low levels and maintaining that situation indefinitely. Each policy has major challenges. We find that that optimal mitigation policies (combining home isolation of suspect cases, home quarantine of those living in the same household as suspect cases, and social distancing of the elderly and others at most risk of severe disease) might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half. However, the resulting mitigated epidemic would still likely result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems (most notably intensive care units) being overwhelmed many times over. For countries able to achieve it, this leaves suppression as the preferred policy option. We show that in the UK and US context, suppression will minimally require a combination of social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of cases and household quarantine of their family members. This may need to be supplemented by school and university closures, though it should be recognised that such closures may have negative impacts on health systems due to increased},

@article{Edeling2021,
abstract = {C ovidSim is an individual-based simulation code developed by the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London. It is a modified version of an earlier model designed to support pandemic influenza planning 1 and has now been used to explore various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) with the aim of reducing the transmission of the coronavi-rus, as documented in the key paper 2 denoted Report 9. CovidSim played an important role in the United Kingdom in reorienting UK Government policy from herd immunity to a strategy focused on suppression of the viral infection. It should be noted, however, that many competitor models exist. Notable examples include the work performed at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (see, for instance, refs. 3,4 and especially ref. 5), in which the effects of different NPIs in the UK are modelled. Another noteworthy model is CovaSim 6 , which is similar in structure to CovidSim in the sense that it models a population of individuals via discrete agents. Likewise, CovidSim creates a network of individuals located in areas defined by high-resolution population density data. In the model, contacts with other individuals can be made in four different types of place, namely, within households, at schools, universities and work places. It is possible to model a combination of different NPIs, namely, general social distancing (SD), social distancing for those over 70 years of age (SDOL70), home isolation of suspected cases (CI), voluntary home quarantine (HQ) and place closure of universities and schools (PC) (see Table 2 of ref. 2). CovidSim contains over 900 input parameters, which are mainly located in two input files. Furthermore, a small number of parameters that define certain characteristics of the intervention scenario one wishes to study are supplied via the command line. We investigated the reproducibility of the code, as has been done in past work 7,8. That said, we especially focus on CovidSim's robust-ness to uncertainty in the input parameters. By robustness in this context, we mean the extent to which the code amplifies uncertainties from the input to the output. Our main aim is to thus take the model as given and examine the uncertainty in its predictions when its parameters are treated as random variables instead of determin-istic inputs. We will use a dimension-adaptive sampling method for this purpose 9 to be able to handle the high-dimensional input space. This type of anisotropic sampling method adaptively exploits a possible low effective dimension, where only a subset of all inputs have a substantial impact on the model output. A wide range of domains have seen the application of such dimension-adaptive samplers, for example, computational electromagnetism 10 , finance 11,12 and natural convection problems 13 , to name just a few. Here we perform a validation study to examine the ability of the predicted output distribution to envelop the observed COVID-19 death count, conditional on a predefined intervention scenario. Due to the large number of inputs, one cannot hope to obtain an accurate, data-informed value of all parameters in contention. Moreover, considering CovidSim's influential status and its likely use in future COVID-19 predictions, it is important to assess the impact of parametric uncertainty on the model output. We will argue the case for the prediction of uncertainty in high-impact decision-making, after we first describe our results. Results We have performed an analysis on the original closed-source version of the code; however, the majority of our sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification efforts lie with the current updated open-source release of CovidSim. With respect to the original version, we have been able to achieve exact reproducibility of the results 2 in Report 9, although only when running within an Azure cloud environment. Attempts to run the code on a Linux-based machine failed; we could not reproduce the same results here and as this version is no longer supported it was not investigated further. Epidemiological modelling has assisted in identifying interventions that reduce the impact of COVID-19. The UK government relied, in part, on the CovidSim model to guide its policy to contain the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic during March and April 2020; however, CovidSim contains several sources of uncertainty that affect the quality of its predictions: paramet-ric uncertainty, model structure uncertainty and scenario uncertainty. Here we report on parametric sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification of the code. From the 940 parameters used as input into CovidSim, we find a subset of 19 to which the code output is most sensitive-imperfect knowledge of these inputs is magnified in the outputs by up to 300%. The model displays substantial bias with respect to observed data, failing to describe validation data well. Quantifying parametric input uncertainty is therefore not sufficient: the effect of model structure and scenario uncertainty must also be properly understood.},

abstract = {Background: There are strong arguments for social science and interdisciplinary research in the neglected tropical diseases. These diseases represent a rich and dynamic interplay between vector, host, and pathogen which occurs within social, physical and biological contexts. The overwhelming sense, however, is that neglected tropical diseases research is a biomedical endeavour largely excluding the social sciences. The purpose of this review is to provide a baseline for discussing the quantum and nature of the science that is being conducted, and the extent to which the social sciences are a part of that.Methods: A bibliographic analysis was conducted of neglected tropical diseases related research papers published over the past 10 years in biomedical and social sciences. The analysis had textual and bibliometric facets, and focussed on chikungunya, dengue, visceral leishmaniasis, and onchocerciasis.Results: There is substantial variation in the number of publications associated with each disease. The proportion of the research that is social science based appears remarkably consistent (<4%). A textual analysis, however, reveals a degree of misclassification by the abstracting service where a surprising proportion of the "social sciences" research was pure clinical research. Much of the social sciences research also tends to be "hand maiden" research focused on the implementation of biomedical solutions.Conclusion: There is little evidence that scientists pay any attention to the complex social, cultural, biological, and environmental dynamic involved in human pathogenesis. There is little investigator driven social science and a poor presence of interdisciplinary science. The research needs more sophisticated funders and priority setters who are not beguiled by uncritical biomedical promises. {\textcopyright} 2011 Reidpath et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

However model complexity and database dimension still remain a constraint.Recently the use of Gaussian random fields has become increasingly popular in epidemiology as very often epidemiological data are characterised by a spatial and/or temporal structure which needs to be taken into account in the inferential process. The Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) approach has been developed as a computationally efficient alternative to MCMC and the availability of an R package (R-INLA) allows researchers to easily apply this method.In this paper we review the INLA approach and present some applications on spatial and spatio-temporal data. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Concurrent with global economic development in the last 50 years, the opportunities for the spread of existing diseases and emergence of new infectious pathogens, have increased substantially. The activities associated with the enormously intensified global connectivity have resulted in large amounts of data being generated, which in turn provides opportunities for generating knowledge that will allow more effective management of animal and human health risks. This so-called Big Data has, more recently, been accompanied by the Internet of Things which highlights the increasing presence of a wide range of sensors, interconnected via the Internet. Analysis of this data needs to exploit its complexity, accommodate variation in data quality and should take advantage of its spatial and temporal dimensions, where available. Apart from the development of hardware technologies and networking/communication infrastructure, it is necessary to develop appropriate data management tools that make this data accessible for analysis. This includes relational databases, geographical information systems and most recently, cloud-based data storage such as Hadoop distributed file systems. While the development in analytical methodologies has not quite caught up with the data deluge, important advances have been made in a number of areas, including spatial and temporal data analysis where the spectrum of analytical methods ranges from visualisation and exploratory analysis, to modelling. While there used to be a primary focus on statistical science in terms of methodological development for data analysis, the newly emerged discipline of data science is a reflection of the challenges presented by the need to integrate diverse data sources and exploit them using novel data- and knowledge-driven modelling methods while simultaneously recognising the value of quantitative as well as qualitative analytical approaches. Machine learning regression methods, which are more robust and can handle large datasets faster than classical regression approaches, are now also used to analyse spatial and spatio-temporal data. Multi-criteria decision analysis methods have gained greater acceptance, due in part, to the need to increasingly combine data from diverse sources including published scientific information and expert opinion in an attempt to fill important knowledge gaps. The opportunities for more effective prevention, detection and control of animal health threats arising from these developments are immense, but not without risks given the different types, and much higher frequency, of biases associated with these data.},

Spatio-temporal data differ from relational data for which computational approaches are developed in the data-mining community for multiple decades in that both spatial and temporal attributes are available in addition to the actual measurements/attributes. The presence of these attributes introduces additional challenges that needs to be dealt with. Approaches for mining spatio-temporal data have been studied for over a decade in the data-mining community. In this article, we present a broad survey of this relatively young field of spatio-temporal data mining. We discuss different types of spatio-temporal data and the relevant data-mining questions that arise in the context of analyzing each of these datasets. Based on the nature of the data-mining problem studied, we classify literature on spatio-temporal data mining into six major categories: clustering, predictive learning, change detection, frequent pattern mining, anomaly detection, and relationship mining. We discuss the various forms of spatio-temporal data-mining problems in each of these categories.},

abstract = {Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one kind of neurodevelopmental disorders common in children. Due to the complexity of the pathological mechanism, there is a lack of objective diagnostic methods up to now. This paper aimed to propose automatic ADHD diagnostic method using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data with the spatio-temporal deep learning models. Unlike traditional methods, this paper constructed a deep learning method called 4-D CNN based on granular computing which were trained based on derivative changes in entropy, and can calculate granularity at a coarse level by stacking layers. Considering the structure of rs-fMRI as time-series 3-D frames, several models of spatial and temporal granular computing and fusion were proposed, including feature pooling, long short-term memory (LSTM) and spatio-temporal convolution. This paper introduced an approach to augment dataset which can sample one subject's rs-fMRI frames into several relatively short term pieces with a fixed stride. The public dataset of ADHD-200 Consortium was used to train and validate our method. And the results of evaluations showed that our method outperformed traditional methods on the dataset (accuracy: 71.3%, AUC: 0.80). Therefore, our 4-D CNN method can be used to build more accurate automatic assistant diagnosis tool of ADHD.},

abstract = {Explosive growth in geospatial and temporal data as well as the emergence of new technologies emphasize the need for automated discovery of spatiotemporal knowledge. Spatiotemporal data mining studies the process of discovering interesting and previously unknown, but potentially useful patterns from large spatiotemporal databases. It has broad application domains including ecology and environmental management, public safety, transportation, earth science, epidemiology, and climatology. The complexity of spatiotemporal data and intrinsic relationships limits the usefulness of conventional data science techniques for extracting spatiotemporal patterns. In this survey, we review recent computational techniques and tools in spatiotemporal data mining, focusing on several major pattern families: spatiotemporal outlier, spatiotemporal coupling and tele-coupling, spatiotemporal prediction, spatiotemporal partitioning and summarization, spatiotemporal hotspots, and change detection. Compared with other surveys in the literature, this paper emphasizes the statistical foundations of spatiotemporal data mining and provides comprehensive coverage of computational approaches for various pattern families. We also list popular software tools for spatiotemporal data analysis. The survey concludes with a look at future research needs.},

abstract = {As a new year and a new decade kick off, WHO is releasing a list of urgent, global health challenges. This list, developed with input from our experts around the world, reflects a deep concern that leaders are failing to invest enough resourcesin core health priorities and systems. This puts lives, livelihoods and economies in jeopardy. None of these issues are simple to address, but they are within reach. Public health is ultimately a political choice. We need to realize that health is an investment in the future. Countries invest heavily in protecting their people from terrorist attacks, but not against the attack of a virus, which could be far more deadly, and far more damaging economically and socially.A pandemic could bring economies and nations to their knees. Which is why health security cannot be a matter for ministries of health alone. All the challenges in this list demand a response from more than just the health sector. We face shared threats and we have a shared responsibility to act. With the deadline for the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals quickly approaching, the UnitedNations General Assembly has underscored that the next 10 years must be the "decade of action". This means advocating for national funding to address gaps in health systems and health infrastructure, as well as providing support to the most vulnerable countries. Investing now will save lives – and money – later. The cost of doing nothingis one we cannot afford. Governments, communities, and international agencies must work together to achieve these critical goals. There are no shortcuts to a healthier world. 2030 is fast approaching, and we must hold our leaders accountable for theircommitments.},

We systematically searched PubMed, Embase and Web of Science from their inception to October 2018, as well as the reference lists of all included studies. Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. Data were double-extracted and discrepancies were resolved by discussion. The overall percentage of healthcare worker encounters resulting in the experience of WPV was estimated using random-effects meta-analysis. The heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic. Differences by study-level characteristics were estimated using subgroup analysis and meta-regression. We included 253 eligible studies (with a total of 331 544 participants). Of these participants, 61.9% (95% CI 56.1% to 67.6%) reported exposure to any form of WPV, 42.5% (95% CI 38.9% to 46.0%) reported exposure to non-physical violence, and 24.4% (95% CI 22.4% to 26.4%) reported experiencing physical violence in the past year. Verbal abuse (57.6%; 95% CI 51.8% to 63.4%) was the most common form of non-physical violence, followed by threats (33.2%; 95% CI 27.5% to 38.9%) and sexual harassment (12.4%; 95% CI 10.6% to 14.2%). The proportion of WPV exposure differed greatly across countries, study location, practice settings, work schedules and occupation. In this systematic review, the prevalence of WPV against healthcare workers is high, especially in Asian and North American countries, psychiatric and emergency department settings, and among nurses and physicians. There is a need for governments, policymakers and health institutions to take actions to address WPV towards healthcare professionals globally.},

@article{Harris2019,

Literature on the twenty-first-century developmental state emphasizes the role of democratic competition and civil society in causing political parties to take up new agendas, while power resources theory stresses the role of left-wing political parties and labor unions in policy adoption. Yet, core tenets of these theories have not been considered extensively in light of dynamics in the industrializing world. This article examines the politics of policy adoption in countries that have recently aimed to provide healthcare access and financial protection to the poor and people in the informal sector in Mexico and Turkey. In line with literature on the twenty-first-century developmental state, we find democratic competition to play an important role in causing political parties to take up new agendas. However, examination of the cases illuminates surprising dynamics that challenge important elements of sociological theory: right-leaning political parties played important roles in adoption, while labor unions and left-wing parties oppose reform in the cases. Public health-minded physicians leading change teams played important roles in agenda setting and leading the process of implementation.},

abstract = {The world has developed an elaborate global health system as a bulwark against known and unknown infectious disease threats. The system consists of various formal and informal networks of organizations that serve different stakeholders; have varying goals, modalities, resources, and accountability; operate at different regional levels (i.e., local, national, regional, or global); and cut across the public, private-for-profit, and private-not-for-profit sectors. The evolving global health system has done much to protect and promote human health. However, the world continues to be confronted by longstanding, emerging, and reemerging infectious disease threats. These threats differ widely in terms of severity and probability. They also have varying consequences for morbidity and mortality, as well as for a complex set of social and economic outcomes. To various degrees, they are also amenable to alternative responses, ranging from clean water provision to regulation to biomedical countermeasures. Whether the global health system as currently constituted can provide effective protection against a dynamic array of infectious disease threats has been called into question by recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, dengue, Middle East respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and influenza and by the looming threat of rising antimicrobial resistance. The concern is magnified by rapid population growth in areas with weak health systems, urbanization, globalization, climate change, civil conflict, and the changing nature of pathogen transmission between human and animal populations. There is also potential for human-originated outbreaks emanating from laboratory accidents or intentional biological attacks. This paper discusses these issues, along with the need for a (possibly self-standing) multidisciplinary Global Technical Council on Infectious Disease Threats to address emerging global challenges with regard to infectious disease and associated social and economic risks. This Council would strengthen the global health system by improving collaboration and coordination across organizations (e.g., the WHO, Gavi, CEPI, national centers for disease control, pharmaceutical manufacturers, etc.); filling in knowledge gaps with respect to (for example) infectious disease surveillance, research and development needs, financing models, supply chain logistics, and the social and economic impacts of potential threats; and making high-level, evidence-based recommendations for managing global risks associated with infectious disease.},

We have identified crucial areas for acceleration in medical countermeasure product development and international coordination. We have also reviewed novel platforms and process improvements related to manufacturing, which could revolutionise the response to the next pandemic. Finally, we created several coordination and engagement guides. These guides range from the rational design of an intervention target product profile, to the key facets of vaccine and therapeutic development, to accelerated manufacturing and regulatory mechanisms. In this Personal View, we provide a high-level summary of the outcomes of the medical countermeasure development workstream, intended for a broad audience including academia, medical countermeasure developers, and multilateral coordinating bodies. We hope that they might find this piece useful in prioritising strategic investments and efforts to accelerate medical countermeasure development.

abstract = {We find ourselves ten months into one of the most catastrophic global health events of our lifetime and, disturbingly, we still do not know how it began. What's even more troubling is that despite the critical importance of this question, efforts to investigate the origins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and of the associated disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have become mired in politics, poorly supported assumptions and assertions, and incomplete information.



To avoid or mitigate the dire consequences of this and future pandemics (here, people in PPE bury a victim in Delhi, India in June), unraveling the origins of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 will be essential—even though a definitive answer may be elusive, and an objective analysis means broaching some uncomfortable possibilities.

SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus whose apparent closest relatives, RaTG13 and RmYN02, are reported to have been collected from bats in 2013 and 2019, respectively, in Yunnan Province, China (1). COVID-19 was first reported in December 2019 more than 1,000 miles away in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. Beyond these facts, the “origin story” is missing many key details, including a plausible and suitably detailed recent evolutionary history of the virus, the identity and provenance of its most recent ancestors, and surprisingly, the place, time, and mechanism of transmission of the first human infection. Even though a definitive answer may not be forthcoming, and even though an objective analysis requires addressing some uncomfortable possibilities, it is crucial that we pursue this question. Preventing the next pandemic depends on understanding the origins of this one.

There are several potential origin scenarios. First, SARS-CoV-2 may {\ldots}

abstract = {The notion of “emerging infectious diseases” (EID) as a category of global health concerns was created in the 1990s to acknowledge that, although public health interventions, vaccines, and antibiotics since the late 19th century had given wealthier parts of the world control over most infectious diseases, the experience of Ebola and HIV/AIDS showed that new human diseases could still arise. “Emerging diseases” have clear histories, and the task the field of EID set itself has been to make those histories as short as possible—to catch emerging diseases as close to their origin as possible and snuff them out before they can become pandemics. In contrast, many of the known infectious diseases, those that were allegedly “conquered” by the rise of biomedicine in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and which (aside from smallpox) nonetheless still persist today, were assumed to have existed “since time immemorial.” Their histories had no specific time-depth, no documentable origins, and few discernible narrative arcs. The advent of a new field of research, palaeogenetics, has made possible an evolutionary perspective on pathogenic microorganisms, bringing hitherto unimaginable specificity to their documentable histories. Many origin stories, and nearly all globalization stories, fall within periods that historians and archaeologists study intensively. I argue that the diseases that have proved best suited to global expansion since the advent of the Holocene—those that became pandemics, like COVID-19—are those that have best exploited humans' global networks and behaviors in a given age. This recognition, in turn, gives the fields of both global health and history of medicine a new agenda.},

abstract = {Background: While the COVID-19 pandemic will increase mortality due to the virus, it is also likely to increase mortality indirectly. In this study, we estimate the additional maternal and under-5 child deaths resulting from the potential disruption of health systems and decreased access to food. Methods: We modelled three scenarios in which the coverage of essential maternal and child health interventions is reduced by 9{\textperiodcentered}8–51{\textperiodcentered}9% and the prevalence of wasting is increased by 10–50%. Although our scenarios are hypothetical, we sought to reflect real-world possibilities, given emerging reports of the supply-side and demand-side effects of the pandemic. We used the Lives Saved Tool to estimate the additional maternal and under-5 child deaths under each scenario, in 118 low-income and middle-income countries. We estimated additional deaths for a single month and extrapolated for 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Findings: Our least severe scenario (coverage reductions of 9{\textperiodcentered}8–18{\textperiodcentered}5% and wasting increase of 10%) over 6 months would result in 253 500 additional child deaths and 12 200 additional maternal deaths. Our most severe scenario (coverage reductions of 39{\textperiodcentered}3–51{\textperiodcentered}9% and wasting increase of 50%) over 6 months would result in 1 157 000 additional child deaths and 56 700 additional maternal deaths. These additional deaths would represent an increase of 9{\textperiodcentered}8–44{\textperiodcentered}7% in under-5 child deaths per month, and an 8{\textperiodcentered}3–38{\textperiodcentered}6% increase in maternal deaths per month, across the 118 countries. Across our three scenarios, the reduced coverage of four childbirth interventions (parenteral administration of uterotonics, antibiotics, and anticonvulsants, and clean birth environments) would account for approximately 60% of additional maternal deaths. The increase in wasting prevalence would account for 18–23% of additional child deaths and reduced coverage of antibiotics for pneumonia and neonatal sepsis and of oral rehydration solution for diarrhoea would together account for around 41% of additional child deaths. Interpretation: Our estimates are based on tentative assumptions and represent a wide range of outcomes. Nonetheless, they show that, if routine health care is disrupted and access to food is decreased (as a result of unavoidable shocks, health system collapse, or intentional choices made in responding to the pandemic), the increase in child and maternal deaths will be devastating. We hope these numbers add context as policy makers establish guidelines and allocate resources in the days and months to come. Funding: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Global Affairs Canada.},

@article{Kretzschmar2020,
abstract = {Background: In countries with declining numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19, lockdown measures are gradually being lifted. However, even if most physical distancing measures are continued, other public health measures will be needed to control the epidemic. Contact tracing via conventional methods or mobile app technology is central to control strategies during de-escalation of physical distancing. We aimed to identify key factors for a contact tracing strategy to be successful. Methods: We evaluated the impact of timeliness and completeness in various steps of a contact tracing strategy using a stochastic mathematical model with explicit time delays between time of infection and symptom onset, and between symptom onset, diagnosis by testing, and isolation (testing delay). The model also includes tracing of close contacts (eg, household members) and casual contacts, followed by testing regardless of symptoms and isolation if testing positive, with different tracing delays and coverages. We computed effective reproduction numbers of a contact tracing strategy (RCTS) for a population with physical distancing measures and various scenarios for isolation of index cases and tracing and quarantine of their contacts. Findings: For the most optimistic scenario (testing and tracing delays of 0 days and tracing coverage of 100%), and assuming that around 40% of transmissions occur before symptom onset, the model predicts that the estimated effective reproduction number of 1{\textperiodcentered}2 (with physical distancing only) will be reduced to 0{\textperiodcentered}8 (95% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}7–0{\textperiodcentered}9) by adding contact tracing. The model also shows that a similar reduction can be achieved when testing and tracing coverage is reduced to 80% (RCTS 0{\textperiodcentered}8, 95% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}7–1{\textperiodcentered}0). A testing delay of more than 1 day requires the tracing delay to be at most 1 day or tracing coverage to be at least 80% to keep RCTS below 1. With a testing delay of 3 days or longer, even the most efficient strategy cannot reach RCTS values below 1. The effect of minimising tracing delay (eg, with app-based technology) declines with decreasing coverage of app use, but app-based tracing alone remains more effective than conventional tracing alone even with 20% coverage, reducing the reproduction number by 17{\textperiodcentered}6% compared with 2{\textperiodcentered}5%. The proportion of onward transmissions per index case that can be prevented depends on testing and tracing delays, and given a 0-day tracing delay, ranges from up to 79{\textperiodcentered}9% with a 0-day testing delay to 41{\textperiodcentered}8% with a 3-day testing delay and 4{\textperiodcentered}9% with a 7-day testing delay. Interpretation: In our model, minimising testing delay had the largest impact on reducing onward transmissions. Optimising testing and tracing coverage and minimising tracing delays, for instance with app-based technology, further enhanced contact tracing effectiveness, with the potential to prevent up to 80% of all transmissions. Access to testing should therefore be optimised, and mobile app technology might reduce delays in the contact tracing process and optimise contact tracing coverage.

abstract = {In the study of geographical patterns of disease, multivariate areal data models proposed so far in the literature (Ma and Carlin, 2007; Carlin and Banerjee, 2003; Knorr-Held and Best, 2001) have allowed to handle several features of a phenomenon at the same time. In this paper, we propose a new model for areal data, the Spatial Temporal Conditional Auto-Regressive (STCAR) model, that allows to handle the spatial dependence between sites as well as the temporal dependence among the realizations, in the presence of measurements recorded at each spatial location in a time interval. Inspired by the Generalized Multivariate Conditional Auto-Regressive (GMCAR) model published by Jin, Carlin, and Banerjee (2005), the STCAR model reduces the unknown parameters to the single parameter of spatial association estimated at every period considered. Unlike the Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) model proposed by Sims (1980), in addition, its space-time autoregressive matrix takes into account the spatial localization of the realizations sampled. Moreover, we already know that the main areas of application of these models relate to disease mapping, disease clustering, ecological analysis (Lawson, Browne, and Vidal Rodeiro, 2003). In this work, however, the STCAR model is applied in business, exploiting the analogy between the danger of contracting a particular disease and the risk of falling into bankruptcy, in order to "reconstruct" the spatial temporal distribution of expected bankruptcies of small and medium enterprises of the province of Lecce (Italy). Zusammenfassung: F{\"{u}}r Studien von geografischen Muster von Erkrankun-gen, erlaubten es multivariate r{\"{a}}umliche Modelle die bis jetzt in der Lit-eratur vorgeschlagen wurden (Ma and Carlin, 2007; Carlin and Banerjee, 2003; Knorr-Held and Best, 2001), mit verschiedenen Charakteristika eines Ph{\"{a}}nomens zur selben Zeit umzugehen. Hiert schlagen wir ein neues Modell f{\"{u}}r r{\"{a}}umliche Daten vor, das Spatial Temporal Conditional Auto-Regressive (STCAR) Modell, das es erlaubt, geografische Abh{\"{a}}ngigkeiten zwischen den Orten als auch die zeitliche Abh{\"{a}}ngigkeit in den Realisationen zu ber{\"{u}}cksich-tigen. Vom Generalized Multivariate Conditional Auto-Regressive (GMCAR) Modell von Jin et al. (2005) inspiriert, reduzieren sich die unbekannten Parameter des STCAR Modells zu einen einzelnen r{\"{a}}umlichen Assoziationspa-rameter der in jeder betrachteten Periode gesch{\"{a}}tzt wird. Im Unterschied zum Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) Modell von Sims (1980), ber{\"{u}}cksichtigt zus{\"{a}}tzlich seine autoregressive Raum-Zeit Matrix die r{\"{a}}umliche Lokalisa-tion der gezogenen Realisierungen. Weiters wissen wir bereits, dass sich die Hauptanwendungsgebiete dieser Modelle mit Erkrankungskarten, dem Clustering von Krankheitsf{\"{a}}llen, und mit Umweltanalysen (Lawson et al., 2003) in Verbindung gebracht werden. Hier jedoch wird das STCAR Modell in der 224 Wirtschaft angewandt und nutzt die Analogie zwischen der Gefahr an einer gewissen Krankheit zu erkranken und dem Risiko bankrott zu gehen, um die r{\"{a}}umlich-temporale Verteilung der erwarteten Konkurse kleinerer und mit-tlerer Betriebe in der Provinz Lecce (Italy) zu "rekonstruieren".},

abstract = {Recognition and analysis of spatial autocorrelation has defined a new paradigm in ecology. Attention to spatial pattern can lead to insights that would have been otherwise overlooked, while ignoring space may lead to false conclusions about ecological relationships. We used Gaussian spatial autoregressive models, fit with widely available software, to examine breeding habitat relationships for three common Neotropical migrant songbirds in the southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee, USA. In preliminary models that ignored space, the abundance of all three species was correlated with both local-and landscape-scale habitat variables. These models were then modified to account for broadscale spatial trend (via trend surface analysis) and fine-scale autocorrelation (via an autoregressive spatial covariance matrix). Residuals from ordinary least squares regression models were autocorrelated, indicating that the assumption of independent errors was violated. In contrast, residuals from autoregressive models showed little spatial pattern, suggesting that these models were appropriate. The magnitude of habitat effects tended to decrease, and the relative importance of different habitat variables shifted when we incorporated broadscale and then fine-scale space into the analysis. The degree to which habitat effects changed when space was added to the models was roughly correlated with the amount of spatial structure in the habitat variables. Spatial pattern in the residuals from ordinary least squares models may result from failure to include or adequately measure autocorrelated habitat variables. In addition, contagious processes, such as conspecific attraction, may generate spatial patterns in species abundance that cannot be explained by habitat models. For our study species, spatial patterns in the ordinary least squares residuals suggest that a scale of 500-1000 m would be appropriate for investigating possible contagious processes.},

@article{Wagner2005,
abstract = {Species patchiness implies that nearby observations of species abundance tend to be similar or that individual conspecific organisms are more closely spaced than by random chance. This can be caused either by the positive spatial autocorrelation among the locations of individual organisms due to ecological spatial processes (e.g., species dispersal, competition for space and resources) or by spatial dependence due to (positive or negative) species responses to underlying environmental conditions. Both forms of spatial structure pose problems for statistical analysis, as spatial autocorrelation in the residuals violates the assumption of independent observations, while environmental heterogeneity restricts the comparability of replicates. In this paper, we discuss how spatial structure due to ecological spatial processes and spatial dependence affects spatial statistics, landscape metrics, and statistical modeling of the species-environment correlation. For instance, while spatial statistics can quantify spatial pattern due to an endogeneous spatial process, these methods are severely affected by landscape environmental heterogeneity. Therefore, statistical models of species response to the environment not only need to accommodate spatial structure, but need to distinguish between components due to exogeneous and endogeneous processes rather than discarding all spatial variance. To discriminate between different components of spatial structure, we suggest using (multivariate) spatial analysis of residuals or delineating the spatial realms of a stationary spatial process using boundary detection algorithms. We end by identifying conceptual and statistical challenges that need to be addressed for adequate spatial analysis of landscapes. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Despite the fact that it provides a potentially useful analytical tool, allowing for the joint modeling of dynamic interdependencies within a group of connected areas, until lately the VAR approach had received little attention in regional science and spatial economic analysis. This paper aims to contribute in this field by dealing with the issues of parameter identification and estimation and of structural impulse response analysis. In particular, there is a discussion of the adaptation of the recursive identification scheme (which represents one of the more common approaches in the time series VAR literature) to a space-time environment. Parameter estimation is subsequently based on the Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) method, a standard approach in structural VAR analysis. As a convenient tool to summarize the information conveyed by regional dynamic multipliers with a specific emphasis on the scope of spatial spillover effects, a synthetic space-time impulse response function (STIR) is introduced, portraying average effects as a function of displacement in time and space. Asymptotic confidence bands for the STIR estimates are also derived from bootstrap estimates of the standard errors. Finally, to provide a basic illustration of the methodology, the paper presents an application of a simple bivariate fiscal model fitted to data for Italian NUTS 2 regions.},

Effective malaria transmission control requires evidence-based targeting and utilization of resources. Disease risk mapping provides an effective and efficient tool for monitoring transmission and control efforts. The aim of this study is to analyse and map malaria risk in children under 5 years old, with the ultimate goal of identifying areas where control efforts can be targeted. Methods: Data collected from the 2016 Ghana demographic and health survey was analyzed. Binomial logistic regression was applied to examine the determinants of malaria risk among children. Model-based geostatistical methods were applied to analyze, predict and map malaria prevalence. Results: There is a significant association of malaria prevalence with area of residence (rural/urban), age, indoor residual spray use, social economic status and mother's education level. Overall, parasitaemia prevalence among children under 5 years old for the year 2016 is low albeit characterized by "hotspots" in specific areas. Conclusion: The risk maps indicate the spatial heterogeneity of malaria prevalence. The high resolution maps can serve as an effective tool in the identification of locations that require targeted interventions by programme implementers; this is key and relevant for reducing malaria burden in Ghana.},

abstract = {The science of networks has revolutionised research into the dynamics of interacting elements. It could be argued that epidemiology in particular has embraced the potential of network theory more than any other discipline. Here we review the growing body of research concerning the spread of infectious diseases on networks, focusing on the interplay between network theory and epidemiology. The review is split into four main sections, which examine: the types of network relevant to epidemiology; the multitude of ways these networks can be characterised; the statistical methods that can be applied to infer the epidemiological parameters on a realised network; and finally simulation and analytical methods to determine epidemic dynamics on a given network. Given the breadth of areas covered and the ever-expanding number of publications, a comprehensive review of all work is impossible. Instead, we provide a personalised overview into the areas of network epidemiology that have seen the greatest progress in recent years or have the greatest potential to provide novel insights. As such, considerable importance is placed on analytical approaches and statistical methods which are both rapidly expanding fields. Throughout this review we restrict our attention to epidemiological issues. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 Leon Danon et al.},

abstract = {Networks offer a fertile framework for studying the spread of infection in human and animal populations. However, owing to the inherent high-dimensionality of networks themselves, modelling transmission through networks is mathematically and computationally challenging. Even the simplest network epidemic models present unanswered questions. Attempts to improve the practical usefulness of network models by including realistic features of contact networks and of host-pathogen biology (e.g. waning immunity) have made some progress, but robust analytical results remain scarce. A more general theory is needed to understand the impact of network structure on the dynamics and control of infection. Here we identify a set of challenges that provide scope for active research in the field of network epidemic models.},

abstract = {Background: The integration of empirical data in computational frameworks designed to model the spread of infectious diseases poses a number of challenges that are becoming more pressing with the increasing availability of high-resolution information on human mobility and contacts. This deluge of data has the potential to revolutionize the computational efforts aimed at simulating scenarios, designing containment strategies, and evaluating outcomes. However, the integration of highly detailed data sources yields models that are less transparent and general in their applicability. Hence, given a specific disease model, it is crucial to assess which representations of the raw data work best to inform the model, striking a balance between simplicity and detail.Methods: We consider high-resolution data on the face-to-face interactions of individuals in a pediatric hospital ward, obtained by using wearable proximity sensors. We simulate the spread of a disease in this community by using an SEIR model on top of different mathematical representations of the empirical contact patterns. At the most detailed level, we take into account all contacts between individuals and their exact timing and order. Then, we build a hierarchy of coarse-grained representations of the contact patterns that preserve only partially the temporal and structural information available in the data. We compare the dynamics of the SEIR model across these representations.Results: We show that a contact matrix that only contains average contact durations between role classes fails to reproduce the size of the epidemic obtained using the high-resolution contact data and also fails to identify the most at-risk classes. We introduce a contact matrix of probability distributions that takes into account the heterogeneity of contact durations between (and within) classes of individuals, and we show that, in the case study presented, this representation yields a good approximation of the epidemic spreading properties obtained by using the high-resolution data.Conclusions: Our results mark a first step towards the definition of synopses of high-resolution dynamic contact networks, providing a compact representation of contact patterns that can correctly inform computational models designed to discover risk groups and evaluate containment policies. We show in a typical case of a structured population that this novel kind of representation can preserve in simulation quantitative features of the epidemics that are crucial for their study and management. {\textcopyright} 2013 Machens et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Networks and the epidemiology of directly transmitted infectious diseases are fundamentally linked. The foundations of epidemiology and early epidemiological models were based on population wide random-mixing, but in practice each individual has a finite set of contacts to whom they can pass infection; the ensemble of all such contacts forms a 'mixing network'. Knowledge of the structure of the network allows models to compute the epidemic dynamics at the population scale from the individual-level behaviour of infections. Therefore, characteristics of mixing networks-and how these deviate from the random-mixing norm-have become important applied concerns that may enhance the understanding and prediction of epidemic patterns and intervention measures. Here, we review the basis of epidemiological theory (based on random-mixing models) and network theory (based on work from the social sciences and graph theory). We then describe a variety of methods that allow the mixing network, or an approximation to the network, to be ascertained. It is often the case that time and resources limit our ability to accurately find all connections within a network, and hence a generic understanding of the relationship between network structure and disease dynamics is needed. Therefore, we review some of the variety of idealized network types and approximation techniques that have been utilized to elucidate this link. Finally, we look to the future to suggest how the two fields of network theory and epidemiological modelling can deliver an improved understanding of disease dynamics and better public health through effective disease control. {\textcopyright} 2005 The Royal Society.},

This model does not take into consideration the spatial distribution of each subgroup, but considers the total number of individuals belonging to each subgroup. There are many variants of the SIR-model. For studying the spatial distribution, stochastic processes have often been introduced to describe the dispersion of individuals. Such assumptions do not seem to be applicable to humans, because almost everyone moves within a small fixed radius in practice. Even if individuals do not disperse, the transmission of disease occurs. In this paper, we do not assume the dispersion of individuals, and instead use the infectious radius. Then, we propose simple continuous and discrete SIR-models that show spatial distributions. The results of our simulations show that the propagation speed and size of an epidemic depend on the population density and the infectious radius.},

abstract = {In this paper we consider a stochastic spatial SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model. We assume that the population is distributed in separate cells. The disease is transmitted within the cell by direct contact, and from cell to cell through an external object (vector or vehicle) capable of carrying the disease. We simulate this model in a 10 x 10 grid of cells, and investigate the effects of the relative rates of transmission within and between cells on the predictability and progression of the disease. Results of simulation indicate that as the rate of intercellular transmission increases relative to intracellular transmission, the mean number becoming effected within each cell increases but so does the spatial variability. We also found that the time for the epidemic to run its course reaches a maximum average value at intermediate relative rates as does the spatial variability. 2 1. Introduction The common mathematical models for diseases are the SIS (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) models, developed by Kermack and McKendrick (see discussion in [2], [5J and [6]). In the case when infective individuals recover and again become susceptible to the disease, the model used is the SIS. In the case when infective individuals recover and attain permanent immunity, we use an SIR model. The classical models do not consider how the population is distributed in space, only the number of individuals in each class. In this paper we describe a spatially discrete model, and simulate this model in a lOx 10 grid of cells. The effects of the relative rates oftransmission within and between cells on the predictability and progression of the disease are investigated.},

This contribution compares different approaches for introducing spatial patterns into these dynamics. The applied techniques cover lattice gas cellular automata (LGCA), stochastic cellular automata (SCA) and partial differential equations (PDE). Even though these methods involve distinct types of spatial interaction, it can be shown, that consistent qualitative and quantitative model behaviour can be obtained by means of parameter adaptions and slight technical modifications. These modifications are motivated by stochastic analysis of distributed interaction (PDE, SCA) and diffusion dynamics (LGCA) as well as prevailing physical analogies. The law of large numbers permits to approximate stochastic contacts by distributed interaction. Diffusion of particles can be approximated through empiric adjustment of a Gaussian diffusion distribution.},

The global existence, positivity, and boundedness of solutions for a reaction-diffusion system with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions are proved. The local stability of the disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium is obtained via characteristic equations. By means of Lyapunov functional, the global stability of both equilibria is investigated. More precisely, our results show that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is less than or equal to unity, which leads to the eradication of disease from population. When the basic reproduction number is greater than unity, then disease-free equilibrium becomes unstable and the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable; in this case the disease persists in the population. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate our theoretical results.},

We show that the solution of a stochastic advection-diffusion partial differential equation provides a flexible model class for spatio-temporal processes which is computationally feasible also for large data sets. The Gaussian process defined through the stochastic partial differential equation has in general a nonseparable covariance structure. Furthermore, its parameters can be physically interpreted as explicitly modeling phenomena such as transport and diffusion that occur in many natural processes in diverse fields ranging from environmental sciences to ecology. In order to obtain computationally efficient statistical algorithms we use spectral methods to solve the stochastic partial differential equation. This has the advantage that approximation errors do not accumulate over time, and that in the spectral space the computational cost grows linearly with the dimension, the total computational costs of Bayesian or frequentist inference being dominated by the fast Fourier transform. The proposed model is applied to postprocessing of precipitation forecasts from a numerical weather prediction model for northern Switzerland. In contrast to the raw forecasts from the numerical model, the postprocessed forecasts are calibrated and quantify prediction uncertainty. Moreover, they outperform the raw forecasts, in the sense that they have a lower mean absolute error.},

abstract = {The outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 has led to a surge in interest in the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases. Such models are usually defined as compartmental models, in which the population under study is divided into compartments based on qualitative characteristics, with different assumptions about the nature and rate of transfer across compartments. Though most commonly formulated as ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, in which the compartments depend only on time, recent works have also focused on partial differential equation (PDE) models, incorporating the variation of an epidemic in space. Such research on PDE models within a Susceptible, Infected, Exposed, Recovered, and Deceased (SEIRD) framework has led to promising results in reproducing COVID-19 contagion dynamics. In this paper, we assess the robustness of this modeling framework by considering different geometries over more extended periods than in other similar studies. We first validate our code by reproducing previously shown results for Lombardy, Italy. We then focus on the U.S. state of Georgia and on the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro, one of the most impacted areas in the world. Our results show good agreement with real-world epidemiological data in both time and space for all regions across major areas and across three different continents, suggesting that the modeling approach is both valid and robust.},

abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is mainly an infectious disease of the respiratory system transmitted through air droplets, and pulmonary symptoms constitute main presentations of this disease. However, COVID-19 demonstrates a clinically diverse manifestation ranging from asymptomatic presentation to critically illness with severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, or multiple organ failure. Accumulating evidences demonstrated that COVID-19 has extrapulmonary involvement, including neurological, smelling sensation, cardiovascular, digestive, hepatobiliary, renal, endocrinologic, dermatologic system, and others. Over a third of COVID-19 patients manifest a wide range of neurological symptoms involving the central/peripheral nervous system. Underlying cardiovascular comorbidities were associated with detrimental outcomes, meanwhile the occurrence of cardiovascular complications correlate to poor survival. Gastrointestinal symptoms frequently occur and have been associated with a longer period of illness. Impaired hepatic functions were associated with the severity of the disease. Higher rate of acute kidney injury was reported in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Endocrinologic presentations of COVID-19 include exacerbating hyperglycemia, euglycemic ketosis, and diabetic ketoacidosis. The most common cutaneous manifestation was acro-cutaneous (pernio or chilblain-like) lesions, and other skin lesions consist of maculopapular rash, vesicular lesions, livedoid/necrotic lesions, exanthematous rashes, and petechiae. This review article summarized the general clinical signs and symptoms, radiologic features, and disease manifestation with progression in patients with COVID-19.},

@article{Goovaerts2006,
abstract = {Background: Geostatistical techniques that account for spatially varying population sizes and spatial patterns in the filtering of choropleth maps of cancer mortality were recently developed. Their implementation was facilitated by the initial assumption that all geographical units are the same size and shape, which allowed the use of geographic centroids in semivariogram estimation and kriging. Another implicit assumption was that the population at risk is uniformly distributed within each unit. This paper presents a generalization of Poisson kriging whereby the size and shape of administrative units, as well as the population density, is incorporated into the filtering of noisy mortality rates and the creation of isopleth risk maps. An innovative procedure to infer the point-support semivariogram of the risk from aggregated rates (i.e. areal data) is also proposed. Results: The novel methodology is applied to age-adjusted lung and cervix cancer mortality rates recorded for white females in two contrasted county geographies: 1) state of Indiana that consists of 92 counties of fairly similar size and shape, and 2) four states in the Western US (Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah) forming a set of 118 counties that are vastly different geographical units. Area-to-point (ATP) Poisson kriging produces risk surfaces that are less smooth than the maps created by a na{\"{i}}ve point kriging of empirical Bayesian smoothed rates. The coherence constraint of ATP kriging also ensures that the population-weighted average of risk estimates within each geographical unit equals the areal data for this unit. Simulation studies showed that the new approach yields more accurate predictions and confidence intervals than point kriging of areal data where all counties are simply collapsed into their respective polygor: centroids. Its benefit over point kriging increases as the county geography becomes more heterogeneous. Conclusion: A major limitation of choropleth maps is the common biased visual perception that larger rural and sparsely populated areas are of greater importance. The approach presented in this paper allows the continuous mapping of mortality risk, while accounting locally for population density and areal data through the coherence constraint. This form of Poisson kriging will facilitate the analysis of relationships between health data and putative covariates that are typically measured over different spatial supports. {\textcopyright} 2006 Goovaerts: licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

@incollection{Olea1999,
abstract = {In the Introduction I mentioned that kriging was formulated from the outset to generalize linear regression, partly in order to consider different supports for the estimate and the sampling. In Chapter 5 we defined support as the shape, size, and orientation of the volume associated with any observation. So far we have not used that potential of kriging. For practical and pedagogic reasons we have been dealing with point estimates or estimates whose supports are small enough at the scale of the sampling domain that one can regard such small supports-cores, plugs, jugs-as points. The practical reasons are obvious. We have been able to cover ten chapters of applications devoted to point formulations. The pedagogic reasons will be clear at the end of this chapter, but in a nutshell, the generalization to estimates with non-point supports does not come without a price. The models are more complex than those for point kriging. Hopefully, at this stage of the exposition, the reader has understood the fundamentals of point kriging and the generalization will be easier to grasp than if we had followed the historical sequence. Block kriging is the generic name given to any form of kriging in which the interest lies in estimation of a linear average for an attribute inside supports that are intermediate in size between the support of the sampling and the sampling domain. Definition 12.1 Let Z (x) be a point support random function in D and let S (xo) c D be a support of finite size S centered around xo. The true block average Zs (.) at location Xo is Zs(xo) = $\sim$ 1 Z(x)dx. 0 s(X o) When Matheron formulated kriging, he presented it in the form of block kriging (Matheron, 1963) partly for mathematical generality but mostly because his immediate concern was estimation of in situ resources, that is, estimates},

abstract = {This article summarizes area-to-point (ATP) factorial kriging that allows the smoothing of aggregate, areal data into a continuous spatial surface. Unlike some other smoothing methods, ATP factorial kriging does not suppose that all of the data within an area are located at a centroid or other arbitrary point. Also, unlike some other smoothing methods, factorial kriging allows the user to utilize an autocovariance function to control the smoothness of the output. This is beneficial because the covariance function is a physically meaningful statement of spatial relationship, which is not the case when other spatial kernel functions are used for smoothing. Given a known covariance function, factorial kriging gives the smooth surface that is best in terms of minimizing the expected mean squared prediction error.

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We examine the interplay between the HIV and COVID-19 epidemics, including the impact of HIV on COVID-19 susceptibility and severe disease, the effect of the COVID-19 epidemic on HIV prevention and treatment, and the influence of the HIV epidemic on responses to COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence to date does not suggest that people living with HIV (PLWH) have a markedly higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with disparities in the social determinants of health and comorbidities likely having a greater influence. The majority of literature has not supported a higher risk for severe disease among PLWH in Europe and the United States, although a large, population-based study in South Africa reported a higher rate of death due to COVID-19. Higher rates of comorbidities associated with COVID-19 disease severity among PLWH is an urgent concern. COVID-19 is leading to decreased access to HIV prevention services and HIV testing, and worsening HIV treatment access and virologic suppression, which could lead to worsening HIV epidemic control. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is threatening gains against the HIV epidemic, including the U.S. Ending the HIV Epidemic goals. The ongoing collision of these two global pandemics will continue to need both study and interventions to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on HIV efforts worldwide.},

This work brings together perspectives on mathematical modeling of infectious diseases, highlights the different modeling frameworks that have been used for modeling COVID-19 and illustrates some of the models that our groups have developed and applied specifically for COVID-19. We discuss three models for COVID-19 spread: the modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model that incorporates contact tracing (SEIR-TTI model) and describes the spread of COVID-19 among these population cohorts, the more detailed agent-based model called Covasim describing transmission between individuals, and the Rule-Based Model (RBM) which can be thought of as a combination of both. We showcase the key methodologies of these approaches, their differences as well as the ways in which they are interlinked. We illustrate their applicability to answer pertinent questions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic such as quantifying and forecasting the impacts of different test-trace-isolate (TTI) strategies.},

abstract = {Influenza (or “flu”) leads to the hospitalization of more than 200,000 people yearly and results in 36,000 deaths from flu or flu-related complications in the United States (15), striking both the elderly and infant populations particularly hard (24). Two members of the Orthomyxoviridae family, the influenza A and B viruses, are the primary causes of this acute viral respiratory disease. Both viruses are characterized as enveloped viruses that contain eight negative-stranded RNA segments that encode 9 structural and 2 nonstructural proteins (influenza A virus) or 10 structural and 1 nonstructural protein (influenza B virus). Because of the higher levels of morbidity and mortality associated with influenza A virus, in part due to the large reservoir of the virus in aquatic birds, we will restrict ourselves to discussions of this virus. Novel influenza virus strains can be the source of infrequent but devastating pandemics, most famously the 1918 pandemic, which killed between 20 and 40 million people (43). These pandemics are associated with major shifts in the HA and NA proteins that define viral strains. More routinely, influenza virus also generates epidemics or large outbreaks. Epidemics can be traced to a drift in the HA and NA proteins that circumvents sufficient preexisting B-cell reactivity so as to render the individual susceptible. Often the influenza virus may produce sporadic localized outbreaks. Such cases have not been the focus of research into influenza epidemiological virology, but it is likely that they are also associated with a transient viral subpopulation with immunoevasive properties, a theory which has been borne out with mathematical models (31, 68, 69). In temperate climates, flu infections at whatever level of intensity are characterized by a flu season. In these areas, the disease is thought to exist at a low level throughout the year but exhibit a marked seasonal increase, typically during the winter months. Influenza epidemics and outbreaks occur in tropical areas as well, although the timing and impact are not as well defined (16, 71, 81). Local epidemics begin suddenly, peak in 2 to 3 weeks, and last for a total of 5 to 10 weeks. It is believed that in most cases seasonal outbreaks of influenza originate in China and spread from there (19). Infectious disease dynamics offer a wide variety of intriguing and unexplained phenomena, yet none is as consistently observed while still remaining so poorly understood as the seasonality of influenza. There is a gap in how diverse studies encompassing immunology, mathematics, epidemiology, and virology combine to form a complete picture of flu seasonality. This may be due to the daunting complexity of seasonality itself, which is likely to reflect the actions of a vast multitude of variables. For whatever reason, only limited research has actually focused on supporting or rejecting each of the proposed underlying causes of the seasonality of influenza, and most of these, while thorough and well supported, are largely confined to a single discipline. This paper will provide a review of the proposed theories from the existing literature and examine possible links among them that may suggest a more-unified view of influenza seasonality, as well as call attention to gaps among the different ways of understanding seasonality. It may be that, once actually understood, the mechanisms governing the seasonal pattern in the incidence of influenza can provide greater insight into all aspects of the dynamics of transmission and maintenance of this disease (59). The authors believe that the current research has reached a stage such that advances in our understanding of influenza seasonality will emerge from an enhanced conceptual understanding of the biological dynamics of infection, not from a breakthrough in mathematical methodology. Therefore, the bulk of the review is devoted to the disease parameters being modeled rather than to modeling techniques, although these are briefly examined in their potential applications.},

abstract = {Objectives Our objective was to review the literature on the inferred duration of the infectious period of COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, and provide an overview of the variation depending on the methodological approach. Design Rapid scoping review. Literature review with fixed search terms, up to 1 April 2020. Central tendency and variation of the parameter estimates for infectious period in (A) asymptomatic and (B) symptomatic cases from (1) virological studies (repeated testing), (2) tracing studies and (3) modelling studies were gathered. Narrative review of viral dynamics. Information sources Search strategies developed and the following searched: PubMed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Additionally, the Health Information Quality Authority (Ireland) viral load synthesis was used, which screened literature from PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, NHS evidence, Cochrane, medRxiv and bioRxiv, and HRB open databases. Results There was substantial variation in the estimates, and how infectious period was inferred. One study provided approximate median infectious period for asymptomatic cases of 6.5-9.5 days. Median presymptomatic infectious period across studies varied over <1-4 days. Estimated mean time from symptom onset to two negative RT-PCR tests was 13.4 days (95% CI 10.9 to 15.8) but was shorter when studies included children or less severe cases. Estimated mean duration from symptom onset to hospital discharge or death (potential maximal infectious period) was 18.1 days (95% CI 15.1 to 21.0); time to discharge was on average 4 days shorter than time to death. Viral dynamic data and model infectious parameters were often shorter than repeated diagnostic data. Conclusions There are limitations of inferring infectiousness from repeated diagnosis, viral loads and viral replication data alone and also potential patient recall bias relevant to estimating exposure and symptom onset times. Despite this, available data provide a preliminary evidence base to inform models of central tendency for key parameters and variation for exploring parameter space and sensitivity analysis.},
